            "Doctor: Sorry to hear that.\n",
            "Patient: I hadn't realized how long it had been since I really listen to it and I all those I was going to delete a whole bunch of messages. And so it made me listen to them before I could listen to anything else. So there were two messages from this guy with the ambulance company has been this whole thing where Blue Cross said, they weren't going to pay for any of the ambulance from one of those times one of the times I was in the hospital because it was like a non-emergency thing and even though so we had to write a grievance to them to say while I didn't have the option of refusing to take the ambulance. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: This is like an ER to the hospital or something. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And so that's been sent in and they've received it. Hopefully they'll pay for some of it at least but I had forgotten that that was sent in that we actually did that because I can't remember anything. So I just thought I'd been ignoring this guy from the ambulance company and then another message was I actually didn't make it through all the messages because I was freaking out too much. Yeah, I had to hang up. So I applied for this job as a substitute teacher in the city with the public schools like back in January or end of December. So I had a message from when I was in the hospital in January offering me a job interview. So that didn't happen. So, you know, I'm started freaking out just telling you about it. It was really freaking out listening to it. I got home and kind of fell apart and you know Jim's comforted me and everything. And that was the rest of the day like this happened right after my appointment with you yesterday and all I could do for the rest of the day with sit and read my book because every time I stopped and you know tried to actually get some work done or do anything I would just fall apart again. Yeah, I don't know how to live like this. It's like I spend so much of my energy not thinking about things while I mean, I can't deal with problems and then I don't have The attention that I ordinarily would have because you know a huge portion of my energy is going toward staving off this Panic that's there all the time. This morning was going okay, but I talked to Amanda on the phone and that was going okay, and she said she really thought that James and I should move to San Antonio and made a pretty good case for it just in terms of having a community, but I just couldn't handle that. I'm kind of trying to talk about anxiety and I feel like I've been trying to act like it's not as much of a big deal as it is, but it's just really devastating for me. I feel like it's crippling me. I'm so scared. I don't even know what I'm scared of. I'm just so scared.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. I think some of what you're scared of is like an intensity of your anger at yourself for not being able to handle things. You feel like you should be able to handle.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I do.\n",
            "Doctor: I think now sometimes you do want to kill yourself for that or kill yourself so you don't have to feel that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of just getting into huge trouble over something. I never know what it is. I'll have forgotten about that turned out to be really important.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you probably don't remember this because it was sort of in the throes of the stuff that we had talked about. how not being able to remember things can feel like having feel like not having control over things in the way you feel you should\n",
            "Patient: I don't remember talking about that.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, and so it can be something you blame yourself alot for I think.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. James you know at the end of the day, thank me for taking care of myself, you know for actually just saying well, I'm not going to be able to get anything done today. I just need to take a day off.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Play felt so bad. I hate that. Yeah, I hate myself when I'm like that. I don't know why I can't just get over it. Or push through it or something. Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen the rest of the day. I really hate this. But I hope I mean at some point I have to listen to the rest of my messages and I hope I'll be able to do that soon, but I don't know. I know it's not that much to deal with but it feels like too much. My dad's coming home tomorrow. We'll see how that goes. Like I just want to hide.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you might worried that I won't react. Well if you hide for a little while.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And then I'm going to say something to you that puts some other Demand on you or limitation or burden that you can't bear.\n",
            "Patient: No, not really. I just don't really have anything to say. I don't worry too much about you. I don't know. I'm not having much to say I think it's working pretty hard not to lose it right now. So I'm not really sure why. I mean, it's just because my nose runs so much.\n",
            "Doctor: That's okay.\n",
            "Patient: Just why is this happening to me? Why is this my life?\n",
            "Doctor: I'm so sorry that it is.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks. There's no reason for me to be so scared of everything. I just am. Shear I really don't want this. Going to go home, and I'm just going to keep going. It seems pretty bleak right now.\n",
            "Doctor: well I think As far as sort of the Dilemma that you're in which is on the one hand to be inclined to say things like maybe not in an existential sense. But in other senses know some of the way things are. Like this now is on what's making you feel so so bad.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And so is how one particular thing sort of happened. They affect you in a in a pretty waste it on the other side. I'm inclined to I'm in line not to say so much about because you seem pretty maxed out with what you can bear and I think that probably pretty well reflects a dilemma that you're in which is the things that could help weather is understanding or tasks. Sort of things or work often feel like way too much.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, we went to dinner with Franco. In Franco's friends, and I went really well and I felt better while we were there, but I really didn't want to go. Yeah. Yeah, I really do want to hear the reasons because that wasn't really a rhetorical question and I feel like I want to know and in other ways I feel like they're not going to give any reasons that are good enough. Yeah, nothing adds up. So I just want to stay away from it. I must have read 400 pages in the last 24 hours. And in other ways understanding doesn't necessarily help. It's interesting. It's distracting sometimes. It's hard for me to think about just the possibility that greater understanding wouldn't be helpful. I mean, I feel like it's kind of one of the foundational principles of life, but like knowing is better knowing will help.\n",
            "Doctor: I think when it comes to this stuff, I think you want to think knowing won't help because I think you don't want to know. We kind of know where a bunch of the bodies are buried at this point. I mean, there's a lot more to learn.\n",
            "Patient: But know you're right.\n",
            "Doctor: I feel like we sort of a bunch and a thing in a number of things. I have become really intolerable for you and some of Y. And it's really hard to keep that in mind. I think I mean like the phone messages I think are actually maybe just the right metaphor like, you know, they're there and it's terrifying because you know, you may not be able to Bear hearing them. and if we wanted to think about it for a few minutes because probably getting much more particular about what would be hard about hearing them the message that you had a job interview, you know, and you never got Not far from stuff we talked about. Again, I don't have a complete understanding or I'm sure that there's a lot of important contacts that I don't have.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But yeah, I think you also. I have no doubt that are moments when you're totally overwhelmed and upset. It feels like you have no idea what's going on or why it's happening but\n",
            "Patient: No, you're right. I know I know why I reacted the way I do. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: If you pretend you don't you don't and then anybody who cares any things that there could be reasons clearly doesn't know.\n",
            "Patient: Heck yeah. Yeah, but I don't want to be like that. fix\n",
            "Doctor: I really want to run with that. I don't think you do this too much intentionally, but I think it's sort of related. I think that a lot has happened recently more historically in your life that sort of in reality as the impression that anybody who sing who thinks they have reason doesn't know what they're talking about. Like it may not be I'm just going to throw it out there. So anyway and won't think about it. So there may be times when you're feeling when your feelings are so intent and you come on in your kind of subtle way. So strongly with them that you we're kind of nearly empty assurances from somebody who are sort of anxious and have a sense of your need and don't know what to do. And that confirms your impression that they clearly have no idea what's going on or what to do.\n",
            "Patient: I have no idea. I can't see you're wrong.\n",
            "Doctor: And certainly a lot about the mental health establishment plays right into that two completely apart of you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I mean, yeah, I want people to tell me it's going to be okay and I'll feel better. But you know, how dare they\n",
            "Doctor: Well, we should stop for now.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thanks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, you filled out your dissertations.\n",
            "Patient: I did.\n",
            "Doctor: How was it to do that?\n",
            "Patient: It was pretty easy.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I'm very familiar with these descriptions.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep. Yep.\n",
            "Patient: So\n",
            "Doctor: What I don't know is are these so before looking at this are they on your mind is Concepts pretty readily.\n",
            "Patient: yes, but I would say I look at Ivan in same that's a little black and white. Or that's a little like I can.\n",
            "Doctor: hahaha\n",
            "Patient: But it's hard for me. I guess to do it as much with myself and even if I do even if I am aware that that's a bit. It's so hard to pull back because some of the emotions that go with that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah, so well-versed and intellectually and then there's Concepts and it sounds like you've been recognizing it and someone else pretty quickly. And yourself is another thing.\n",
            "Patient: Right, and it's hard to be objective when you're looking at yourself.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I'm thinking is this all-or-nothing thinking or is this a little more realistic than I want to admit?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: so it's hard sometimes so\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, we're there any that did not but did feel ambiguous or anything you want to talk about specifically as you were feeling it out.\n",
            "Patient: I think emotional reasoning is one that I felt a little stumped on I guess I feel like I do it but I'm not quite sure what a good example would be. I mean I gave one but I don't know if it's as good as it.\n",
            "Doctor: What was the example that you gave?\n",
            "Patient: That sometimes I'm worried that things in my marriage might not improve enough or what if they don't are all of the what ifs and then what am I going to do? If it doesn't what am I going to? And I wonder if that isn't based on how it feels more than based on the progress that's been.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: like the timeline or facts or the\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: So it feels a little less concrete of an example.\n",
            "Doctor: No, but I follow you as an example and non example, can you identify what is the feeling then? So if your reasoning with emotions, what is the emotion?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's fear mostly. anxiety what if anxiety?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so does this I actually think this is one of the hardest ones for people to really get inside themselves and work with. More than any of the others they get in till actually a grass for one, but then you need to from intellect down to the emotion. This one basically the idea is that if you have a feeling it does not mean that is indicating a fact about a situation, right? You got that sea urchin afraid that something will never change. Is that what's the thought?\n",
            "Patient: Is that but there's also the things might be changing somewhat, but it's not fast enough. It's not this enough. It's not enough. It doesn't meet up where my expectations it doesn't meet up where I thought things would be so what if it doesn't continue to progress or what if it doesn't Progressive at a rapid and that's what I said and snowballs a bit. But then I would go through the steps to try to rationalize it. I would think actually that's a lot of progress in a short. Of time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep.\n",
            "Patient: Or actually this this unless they're really good steps that have made a big difference. But then I sometimes have a little bit before giving but I think to myself I've put up with you know, a lot of this type of thing for a really long time. No wonder I'm you know, kind of really impatient and ready to move on be done with it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: So I sometimes think that\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, this example I think is a little complicated for good reason.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's what you're bringing up. So for example, I hear you also and what you're describing what if this never changes. If there's still a lot of anger. Because there's not just oh things were exactly what I thought they were and then he's changed a lot and I'm just not giving him credit for that. He's changing and yet that's coupled with your also knowing and still coming into knowing. That he has never where you thought he was to begin with. So it does sound like you have some realistic anxiety actually not just a rational about what if he changes a lot and that's still where he wants to still feels like it's not enough for me.\n",
            "Patient: I also worried that I guess I could change my expectations and lower them. Because I feel like this is terribly critical but I think to myself like not pushing him to apply to other jobs. I'm even going to be content with him being a manager at Subway because he's struggling with it still at time. And I wonder if you know where would be the answer for him. Actually, that could be the worst. Even if it looks like a great job or more money or more. Whatever. So I find myself thinking that that and I kind of don't like myself for it. Because I'm thinking oh, wait a minute. This is not at all. What we thought would be the case. Don't worry about that, too.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah you again that sounds more. Like it's a worry Basin some understanding of the possibilities of reality. What if for example for him to feel like he was functioning at his best in a life that he was happy with you was going to be a manager at Subway for the next 20 years. You have to take in your breath even\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: and he was happy doing that and he managed to find some way of functioning while doing that. What do you do then? Is that enough for you?\n",
            "Patient: The thing that happens with that type of hypothetical scenarios is a small part of me looks at Ivan and says, what would that be like what happened? Or why is that you know?\n",
            "Doctor: haha\n",
            "Patient: Again, there's nothing wrong with being a manager at Subway. But if you have the potential to do something and you studied a specific field and\n",
            "Doctor: Yep. Yep.\n",
            "Patient: What happens with that what happened? So there's a small part of me that thinks that that but there's a bigger part of me that thinks what is wrong with me? That would be the type of snobby whatever person that being married to someone who's the manager at Subway wouldn't be enough or would it be fulfilling his potential or would it be? Like what does that say about me?\n",
            "Doctor: So just press you for a second. Does your mind go to something in particular? What are you saying? What does it say about me? It seems like you get very self-critical.\n",
            "Patient: Well, yes, and I guess I want to be so critical of myself and that because that's just not I would never look down at anyone who works there. But then if it's my husband who is working as a manager at Subway and I think about him doing that for 20 years. I think that's not I don't know. It's not exactly what I would have thought would be fulfilling his potential. Or what? I thought you know you think his college education would look like or I guess not the type of West lifestyle. I thought maybe even money-wise not. And he's not really passionate about working at a sandwich shop. So I would feel like it would just be a job which some people have, you know, just a job and that's not their big thing in life. That's okay, but I don't know if that's what I I don't know if it's okay with me. I don't feel good about that. I feel like that makes me this horrible snobby demanding critical. Because I guess when I feel like when you marry someone it shouldn't be I'm marrying you because I know you are a lawyer or a doctor. Are you not like and you will always are in a good living and have a you know, fulfilling career that will last you until retirement. Do you feel satisfied with the errands good money. That is secure they're passionate about I'm not sure. That's the right reason to marry someone it certainly didn't factor into why married Ivan, but now that we're married I feel guilty about wanting those things.\n",
            "Doctor: I want to know if there's a way you sort of discount. It has it shouldn't matter at all.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe it can matter some but I feel like I guess I feel like that says something pretty bad about me if that's not okay.\n",
            "Doctor: But your snobby is at what that's about.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know. It really sounds like I'm stuck up. Like being a manager at Subway, you know, it's an honest job. It's a good job. But why would that not be good enough?\n",
            "Doctor: So why would it not be good enough?\n",
            "Patient: I think there's a part of that if it wasn't Ivan's one dream to manage a sandwich shop, and he wanted to say that he wanted to stay with this and work his way up or just keep doing it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: The back could feel a lot better A lot different.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And if we came to the realistic understand that that was his passion and that's what he was going to do, but he wasn't going to pay the bills you were going to compensate through me for him doing another job like some way.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like that would be more and more realistic scenario. That's not the case and what if the reality is this type of job is you know, totally unrelated to what he went to school for what if that's the best bit for him now for a while. It's scary for me and I feel bad about that. I feel responsible that he doesn't feel proud of it. But he's like afraid to feel proud of it.\n",
            "Doctor: If you were a doctor right now.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Making a ton of money and working all the time. So you never saw him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: like in other words like your father\n",
            "Patient: Yep.\n",
            "Doctor: I would certainly imagine that you would have a problem with that, too.\n",
            "Patient: That's the weird thing because I hated never seeing my dad. I got to the point where I didn't want to see my dad because I was so angry at him that I was never going to come first.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And yet it was easier in a way because I could be proud of his, you know, great education of an incredible work ethic the fact that he owned and ran his own business completely by himself.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: The fact that he was coming home, you know at an ungodly hour, but he just delivered a you know, knew something rather. He just saved some animals life is just did some crazy for our surgery. That feels it doesn't feel good. Don't give me wrong. It doesn't feel good. But it feels very different.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: From like the polar opposite like Russ ambition miseducation us drive less work ethic. Not passionate about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah in a way then with your father. That's what you were used to to sort of getting to feel good about with his at least.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Is really driven successful smart.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And he compared to most of my friends parents. Nobody's parents worked longer hours. Nobody had more education that my dad nobody. I felt proud of that. I do think that's okay. I think that's a healthy thing to feel proud about I guess the other part that made it feel okay was the thought of my mind that he could have it that he could if he had had, you know, Partners or whatever if he had joined a practice he could have had normal hours and made a good living. And still have been the success so it wasn't like that. There was more potential for it. Yeah, it does.\n",
            "Doctor: Also, maybe in a way he's not there for you, but is very professionally successful maybe with Ivan right now. It's feeling like you're not getting either of those you haven't been getting either of those. It's not that he's the opposite of your dad and always there for you always catering to you buy me flowers figuring out what you need to know putting you front and center and he's not that successful there. So it feels like both Realms you're missing out and I think that's what has been really disappointing.\n",
            "Patient: It does and I guess the other maybe it's most important to me now at this point in my life, but my dad is like she's not always there and conversations with him are usually very short and he's driving on his way to a call. But he's incredibly supportive. It was incredibly supportive when I was going to school if I wanted to do another program tomorrow. She would be ridiculously support a puppet. Not financially or anything, but he would just always want to ask about it the encouraging.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: End up looking for jobs. He's very supportive. I guess he's always wanting to talk about and be involved with jobs and academics and that's important at this point in my life. And Ivan is not up to talking about this topics right now. And I guess it's also more of it's a bigger thing because those are topics that I associate with adulthood or being you know mature and responsible. Having it together having a career and a plan for your life being motivated and ambitious. But I do also wonder if Ivan continues to make progress with his depression with his attention disorder if he continues to like he sort of gets to a baseline with his job where he gets to the point where he's doing it well and things are going smoothly consistently and he feels like he could potentially maybe you could reach that to maybe\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, all of what you're talkin about that started with this particular disc Distortion. It does sound Ramona. I've said this before but you just say again because you're acting class what you're thinking about his job and only I must be very snobby if that's not good enough for me. It really sounds like you're saying You are not drawn to him not being passionately practically engaged in something which is very different than saying. I just can't be married to someone who's a Subway manager. What you still might have a problem with some people might some people might not for various reasons, right? There are different things that kill valuable to people but if she had come to you two years ago, but you know what, I love retail, I love you know, like multitasking and I thinking I went to work to become an owner of a store one day orino buy a franchise. This is why I'm going to get into what do you think of Subway and if it had? So thoughtful and proactive and driven by a passion for something passion for sandwich events, you know, like, you know, he's starting to learn about all different kinds. I mean, but still might be disappointing in one way if it was sort of Oh, I thought I was marrying someone who's going to this and what does that mean for his identity and you know, can I get used to that but maybe not in all the ways it's been disappointing because there's something in his personality or attention deficit\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You know what? I mean?\n",
            "Patient: No, yes, it it sounds accurate actually to what I'm feeling and one of the biggest things that I that doesn't feel fair to criticize but in finding that our expectations my expectations when she said we're totally on board like he was on board with them. They were correct. You led me to believe this was all how is going to be.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep, he even can acknowledge that.\n",
            "Patient: Right well to some extent. I mean he clearly he said he left grad school because it wasn't for him and I had a really tough time with that. But that was something I was going to be able to accept what actually happened not so much but the bear problem with it is I feel like I haven't has no clue what he wants out of life right now.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like if I told him tomorrow we should buy a house you'd be like, yeah, let's work up towards that. If I said we should start a family tomorrow, he would probably that might be a little extreme. But the point is I feel like he's been wishy-washy one random job to the next. And just you know going with whatever is given to him just not proactive not engaged not motivated or ambitious. What does he what does he really want? How do I know that he really wants to be married to me if he doesn't know any like an idea of a type of career?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Or did you ever want to go back to school? Does he ever want to you know own a house and things like that? I guess I feel like he has no clue and that's not something that is so acceptable to me. And that's another where it's easier with. My dad. My dad has never had a different career.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Like you've never been unemployed since you was email a teenager before then. I mean she just never discussed. Yeah, that's hard to take in a guilty part of me inside things Ivan's almost old enough. What if he was about to be a doctor? What if he was about to be a lawyer or a baby? Awesome? like to be married to someone who was I don't know energetic and had a great career that they were passionate about and did a lot with.\n",
            "Doctor: Your two choices of Role Models wear that or your mom.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: And not a lot of space in there in either case where someone actually taken care of you really really loving and being there for you. Maybe in your sister. That's as close as you got.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah completely in Emma.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But again, she does something that she's very passionate about and works incredibly hard and has been ambitious and getting more degrees and going above and beyond her 40 hours a week. And it's just hard for me to look at Ivan and be this is horrible but to be satisfied. With the way that so the only way I'm coping with it is stinking suggest for now.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Is trying to get on his feet. It's not the end of the world. This is actually the best job. He's ever had in his life so far like the most responsibilities the most skills to be developed. by far\n",
            "Doctor: It's actually a hard job.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Yeah, he's never had to manage people. He's never had to be accountable for meeting timeline throughout the day and managing his time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's a lot of responsibilities and tasks. Yeah, and yet I also hear what you're saying and it still feels like it's kind of holding ground in a way rather than a sense of being chosen Representatives stop in him. And that may be what steering right with scary right now is how little since he has about the future\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it does not feel good. Especially for someone like me who feels like they need to be in control.\n",
            "Doctor: is everything\n",
            "Patient: right I feel like I have to have a pretty clear plan.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I'm upset with myself right now because I don't know what my next step is. So it's like really it's not feeling very tolerable.\n",
            "Doctor: Ramona how is your depression anxiety been this week?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I saw you not that long ago.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But I guess things it feels pretty intense sometimes. The depression I will say I've noticed a couple of times where it's been a great day. I spent time with Emma or Ivan or both. Just that type of day and I'm still finding myself feeling down on myself feeling like a little down feeling like there's no explanation for it in the moment. Look at the moments where I feel like there is underlying depression and it's not always.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Directly a result of something that happens.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you're saying the day can be going well even between you and Ivan.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe on any given day and you can still feel you said specifically down on yourself.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Not just lonely, but specifically self-critical.\n",
            "Patient: I think that's more the self-hate than the depression.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Although I'm sure that's connected, but I can feel a little low sometimes.\n",
            "Doctor: So where do your thoughts go in that place when you say down on yourself, like what are the thoughts and that emotional low?\n",
            "Patient: It's pretty much like things are going well and make a mistake or I say something that I think back on and I wish I would have said that differently or I wish I would have done that differently. I wish I\n",
            "Doctor: like at a job interview you mean\n",
            "Patient: yeah, that could be it. Or simple as I wish I hadn't kept my sister waiting or I wish I was more decisive about that and it's I hate myself and then it can stay low for a little while. And then like I'll move past it but it's a very I don't know why but those are three words that come into my mind when something like that happens. Let's become a coping thing for me. I know that's unhealthy, and I want to work on that.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, see you can think of an example specifically you named a couple saying it could be that as it could be that is there something you remember it at all happening since I saw you last.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's embarrassing. So my parents gave me a gift certificate for clothing at two different stores for my birthday. Because I needed some clothing and so those stores are having sales. So I went with Emma. She needed some stuff too, and I kept her waiting. I was taking longer like she was ready to go sooner than I was.\n",
            "Doctor: So you were in the story mean?\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Try things on.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, she's ready to go when you're still.\n",
            "Patient: I'm still trying to make decisions and I find myself like catching myself and like it doesn't have to be perfect Corona. Just because you know, you don't usually go shopping or you've been given this great gift that you feel really guilty about does it mean that you have to Analyse which sale is the best to an extent Beyond normal. It doesn't mean you have to obsess over spending it perfectly most wisely, whatever. And you're keeping your sister waiting. She works like crazy all week. And you don't and this is how she spending our weekend. You need to be more considerate. Feeling self-conscious because I felt like in that time she's taking care of me like she always has. She doesn't know how to stop doing that. I don't know how to. I just I feel like I need to step up more so that she doesn't feel like she has to sometimes. I'm thinking oh I should have just come by myself. I feel so bad that I or just come back another time. I'm taking too much time. I was just thinking I hate myself like this is unacceptable. How can I be doing this to her?\n",
            "Doctor: You're burning her.\n",
            "Patient: And in reality, she's just like it's fine. If I would have tried on that I would have taken a longer to\n",
            "Doctor: Is so striking how quickly can escalate to I hate myself which is such a strong thing to say about yourself.\n",
            "Patient: it doesn't I think I have normalized it. Not to be but it doesn't.\n",
            "Doctor: No, no, I hear you. I hear you.\n",
            "Patient: Have a huge impact on me.\n",
            "Doctor: It's almost like you don't realize how many that is. You're just used to that being the running threat almost.\n",
            "Patient: It feels necessary for me to feel bad about it. Just like when I got the gift card at felt necessary, I felt absolutely necessary for me to feel bad.\n",
            "Doctor: To say I hate myself for something like why is it necessary to feel bad when someone gives you a gift?\n",
            "Patient: I always do. I don't know completely why I always do. I think it's really it's the money exclamations with money. Being spent on me. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So one of the things I wonder because you're describing it both in money. And then also in time your sisters time if it is been hard for you to be given to like really for someone to lovingly give you something that you to you that you take it sounds like that's hard.\n",
            "Patient: I know it is but I think that's them if someone doesn't feel very good about themselves. They don't really feel good about.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: You know.\n",
            "Doctor: You feel guilty. You feel like you didn't deserve it. You feel like you're taking from them.\n",
            "Patient: I wish I could give it back like I wish I could.\n",
            "Doctor: It's like an absence Ramona inside you. . Foundation of just having been given to lovingly give it to just knowing that's part of the way of loving relationships work. I think this comes up a little here with me too. But what if I were to give you in a way as a metaphor a second session to help you and say I want to help you. I want to give this to you. I want take care. Hope you feel better. I think that's disorienting for you. Like you almost don't be used to being having to the whip out people mistreating. You people not taken care of you having to scramble to make sure you take care of other people.\n",
            "Patient: But even so I've mentioned and it's a very brief way to describe it. But Emma has taken care of me since I was little\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: in so many ways and she still does it. In different ways so she comes over because we will plan to do dinner sometimes so she'll come over especially if I've been still at work. And will cook something until sometimes bring over. So just show up with this ingredient with ingredients for a new recipe and she'll say oh I just stop by the store. Let's make this new pasta salad. And it's taking care of me in a way or even if I do the cooking but she still comes over and talks with me about my day and she still follows up. Like how did your interview go? And she's always still taking care of me and she's always been very reluctant to share if you even a small thing in her day went wrong. She's very much the mom.\n",
            "Doctor: She is yeah.\n",
            "Patient: She's buried. Yep, because she's always she's like, but then you will get upset. I don't want to wear you about it. I don't want that to be on your mind. I don't want you to feel like you can't talk to me about something that's going wrong because you're worried about me. Like just really to an extreme. She's been my mom. She's 29. I mean like and I tried to tell her even though I think and she's you know, she still feels that way. I think especially because of the role Ivan is played this far.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I wish you didn't feel like she had to take care of me and I don't know I always feel bad. So even if she comes over after a long day of work and we make dinner or even if I make her dinner, I still feel a little bad because\n",
            "Doctor: It's interesting. It's a dynamic that's gotten set up with her. It sounds like since you were very little.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah very much. So I mean not only is she taking care of me now, but when things with Mom and Dad were explosive. She was there to talk it out and make sure I was okay, but even to the extent of Ramona did you do this? Do you want to take care of this? How is it going just really mothering. Really mothering in a very loving way in a very caring way not in a controlling way. But I feel really bad about that. It must be exhausting for her.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, she's doing in a way that should have happened with your own mother so that your sister and you could be freed up to have a sister relationship instead of more mothering one. So that's what's so complicated. Then you actually get this loving care what you need and yet it's in a place that leaves you with kind of Rocky feelings about it because it's not actually where it should be coming from even more so\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I feel bad because she's not telling me about her bad days. Emma is not a complainer, but she's not like nothing and that doesn't feel like a two-way street because it's not so much all the time. She's really mostly and she'll say sometimes you don't realize your Moana but when I come over and we do dinner or whatever that helps even if I don't talk about how bad my day was it helps me do stress and it helped me get away for a little bit. So I don't know but I always wonder if there's a part of me that is it still feeling like I need or wanting that motherly care. Like I didn't get enough as a poor way to put it but I still\n",
            "Doctor: You didn't get enough.\n",
            "Patient: Want it or need it? And now I'm actually at an age where it's like get over it because it's no longer appropriate. It's no longer. I should no longer need it for the most part.\n",
            "Doctor: So here's here's where I so coming back to your specific scenario. One of the things that I think it's a story where their self hatred comes up is what you're saying right now that you should no longer need that. I don't think that's true. I think you were incredibly deprived as a child what you need of what you needed, but I think adults need that too. And that's actually what you hope to find in friends and partners killing one's mother and father right even as an adult you've asked the number of times. What does that actually look like lacking of all models for example about what does it look like when a healthy married couples doing it? Well, and I think it includes being quote somewhat mother Ali if you were going to use that as The Stereotype of what it mean to say to someone. How was your day? How is that going? You know, how was Interview? Oh, have you done this? Oh, how are you feeling? You were sick yesterday the kind of following up on. If we're just calling that basically seeing caring about the life of another person. It's fundamental to every healthy relationship not something you need to get over. That's what you want to be part of your marriage and you want it to be reciprocal. That's what's different about not being motherly right in that place. It's a mother's job to be that caring concern child and for the child not necessarily early on to eat have to even think about how the mother is doing so much overtime easily get to know moms having a bad day at maybe I'll set the table for her or something like that. But I think you have to be so preoccupied about what your mother's mind. Way way too young in your life. You were deprived of it and yet it's normal. It's a normal healthy part of relationships. Like for example, this is what I say when you're going to the mall to go shopping. On any given any different relationship any given day, you're not being selfish by having your sister away a little bit too while you try on clothes. It could be as she said to you Ramona. I have 30 minutes and then I have to be out of here because I have a job interview. So Su 30 minutes and then you know say you were driving her and then you kept trying on clothes and totally ignoring her deadline. I'm guessing that's not what happened, right?\n",
            "Patient: No, no.\n",
            "Doctor: She didn't say she had limited time.\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: So what did what she does for you there sounds like part of a healthy relationship even sister hood that that could exist in a way. That's not a problem at all. It's healthier if you're doing that for her sometimes too if it's reciprocated and it sounds like she has had a hard time taking that in.\n",
            "Patient: She does not know.\n",
            "Doctor: So that might be the growing edge of a relationship with her. Is to be able to start saying you know, what when are you going to try on clothes? Because I want to be there for you. I want I have some time right now pushing into taking care of her son, but I don't think the answer is going to be. Oh you just need to not be taken care of anymore. I think you start to hate yourself when you get taken care of and that's the healthy. That's a healthy thing. You want to happen every relationship. Do you know what I mean? So even there may be ways this plays out with Ivan. Sometimes can you be taken care of by him? Is there anything he could do that? We actually take care of you.\n",
            "Patient: so\n",
            "Doctor: And can you all go ahead?\n",
            "Patient: no, I didn't mean to interrupt that something doctor Pharaoh just came up with she said that we should work with our individual therapist and come up with something that the others could do.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, huh?\n",
            "Patient: Every day, she said I think it should be everyday.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep.\n",
            "Patient: She gave the example of she said every couple does this there's something they need from the other one and it's not the you do the dishes. I do the laundry.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: she said it's like\n",
            "Doctor: something more emotional\n",
            "Patient: yeah, so she says it could be I need you to meet me everyday at 5 after work at home. And have a glass of wine and talk about my day and ask about it. She said that that could be one Partners request and that that's so she said we should work with and try to come up with something like that. Do I have?\n",
            "Doctor: That's so we have 5 minutes.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: A little actually we started a couple minutes. So it's 7 minutes. It's so interesting because of some ways that started making explicit. Here's what I need to be taken care of. Can you do this thing and not only can you do it, but can I take it in then? What is it like when this need gets meant? Have you thought of anything?\n",
            "Patient: I thought about I told her I thought it was hard because sometimes the Baseline like that you do the laundry. I do the dishes doesn't get mad. And I'm like, why would I add something else to the list when we're not you know that she said just to give it a try. So I thought about the you know, so I mean 30 minutes a day that he could just talk with me about my day. I would feel good.\n",
            "Doctor: Busy right now Ramona everyday say oh, how was your day?\n",
            "Patient: That's the thing. I think it's more about his absent-mindedness. But everyday whenever he gets home from work, I'll ask him about work. We don't always have a big discussion, but it's always like how was work. How did it go? It doesn't always immediately reciprocate with that. I think part of it is just the way his family is everybody jumps and then there's not much asking it's like everybody just says so nobody takes the time to ask and part of it is just I think he forgets and it gets a little But it feels great when he does it. So that was the thought.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Actually, I'm sorry if I could completely not that that's not important. But if I could completely switch gears for the last 5 minutes.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. Yeah shirts.\n",
            "Patient: I am I should have done this earlier, but I guess I feel like I need something. I don't know. This job search is getting depressing. I'm feeling depressed and down on myself. I need I think an emotional boost or some kind of boost because I'm getting to the point where I'm like, why am I even going to look on this job where there isn't going to be anything? And a lot of them there hasn't been anything lately. That would be appropriate or me to apply for. You got a genuine thing that feeling like oh, there won't be anything. Even if there is I have to do the application. If I do that, I won't get an interview. I got an interview I won't get the job offer. It's just I don't know that I know that I'm doing that to myself and the other night. I had this freak out. I thought I'm not going to get a job and it's going to be my fault because I stopped doing applications. You can't get a job remote if you don't apply and so I need a way to keep going.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it starting to feel like to feel kind of like you're hopeless Ness is Raising. So it gets harder to do to go to then go do the things that you feel like nothing is going to come of this anyway.\n",
            "Patient: it is and it's also feeling frustrating to spend like a couple of hours and all I can say is I looked through the job boards for this this and this and there was nothing and that time is gone and I still don't have a job Yeah, it's feeling daunting and exhausting. And I feel like it's tomorrow's two weeks since that interview for that really good job, and I haven't heard anything about a second interview. I'm starting to feel like I got all these interviews and I was great but now the interviews has have stopped. My applications have stopped a lot and I have no offers.\n",
            "Doctor: Scooter stores in a distortion challenging thought just to throw us in the mix and this was my fear when you were trying to apply for jobs all the way from the beginning was that you were going to expect something was going to work out within the first month or two even pretty much every single person who applies for a job in whatever field right. Now the average time to get a job at 6 to 8 months at least right that is a state of affairs and employment. It's incredibly competitive. There are people applying for jobs are extremely overqualified there people applying for jobs that then gets filled internally.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: They only had to advertise it, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So it sounds like you really need to work hard to adjust your expectations about the time frame and I think more about applying for your job at your job.\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: meaning\n",
            "Patient: oh that you\n",
            "Doctor: but you said specific times if it comes listening? I have to get I have to get I have to get I have to get and you're going to build hopelessness every day that passes with the more you start say Okay example looking at my job or every day 7 days a week sounds like the fastest way to get yourself feeling hopeless because you're going to reach a point where new things are going to come up. It's going to feel like beating your head against the wall. So I mean, I wonder if you could Slot 2 or 3 days where you look and letting it go on the other days getting specific time frames where you don't work on things and just be thinking of this as this is part of what you're doing in the backdrop. I don't think if it feels like you have to get another job in the meantime, if you knew for example right now it's going to take eight months until you find job.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, clearly, I need to be working.\n",
            "Doctor: You would.\n",
            "Patient: Of course, where's the money going to come from one positive thing? I did which I'm hoping will help is I joined Career Services set up this job Seekers Workshop. And it's literally for new graduates. Pasadena Career Services meeting once a week and doing a check in and talk about strategies and things like that. But I feel like I need to push myself to go to networking events and to do more.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Like getting more resumes out there, even though I feel self-conscious. Because not only just in an application but just professors. I know that may or may not have research for me like no opportunities just reaching out to them and letting them know I'm looking things like that.\n",
            "Doctor: yep, I think one of the hardest things for you about this process in the reality of finding and solidifying a job which is not just for you but for anyone and probably specifically for any new graduate in the field where you're coming with less experience and someone else is the hit rate is very very very low meaning you could go through 300 applications and one of them will come to and the problem is let's say You get up to 211th and then 212 and 213 and what you're saying to yourself I put in 213 applications and not a single one has come to fruition. So it can feel more helpless, but if you're going to but if you know on the back of your mind that one and three hundred you'll get a job offer the less you start going off right now. You actually are decreasing your chances of getting a job. It's just a low hit rate. Right like imagine the pitting the pigeons hitting and every 300 * 1 + 300 going to go off and you'll get the food palette.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: So if it stops taking it's definitely not going to get the food pellet, but it's very very very very infrequent reinforcement. And I think that's part of what's Happening you're doing something and something happens, you know, you know, right cause and effect immediate effect of your option action you go clean, it's clean. So this is really hard to kind of persist and I know that the reinforcements will come but it's very very infrequently enforcement. It's just that those are the facts. So the more you start with challenging Moscato, it's hopeless with I don't know what you could replace that with has an effect everything. I do might have an effect, but I just don't know which is going to have an effect on your also giving yourself days off or you're not\n",
            "Patient: I am because\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: It's like after spending hours on the computer. It's like I just can't be on the computer anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, do you think it would help you Ramona to have something part-time that you were doing? And I mean that specifically around forget even the money was so you had money would it help you to?\n",
            "Patient: I have\n",
            "Doctor: Restructure to have something to go to part-time.\n",
            "Patient: so every Monday I go spend five hours to volunteer on that study.\n",
            "Doctor: OU 200\n",
            "Patient: And now yeah, I do. The thing is is other people get paid to do exactly what I'm doing. But by the time I joined the study, I feel like she's out of grant money. So I'm not getting $15 an hour. I'm getting nothing, but it's just frustrating but it's good for my resume.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And now Friday I start orientation for a patient. Advocacy at Walter Reed.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Which is something I'm interested in. I'm interested in patient navigation, which is pretty related, but that's also volunteer.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: I've been told by one of my professors that you got to be at least volunteering you'll go crazy if you just do nothing but apply to jobs, so I'm hoping like it can't hurt.\n",
            "Doctor: It's building a resume.\n",
            "Patient: It is.\n",
            "Doctor: It's going to help.\n",
            "Patient: And hopefully I'll make some connections.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's nothing else is adding and it's giving me something to get out of the apartment and feel productive.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, also telling yourself a year from now you'll be somewhere. I know that's a long ways away but it will happen. I think it's also with Ivan something is going to happen and enough will happen that you will feel better or nothing will happen and you will feel worse, but you'll know more in a year. This is the hardest time ever. So try and take a deep breath and just trust that something is going to happen and you're not going to be in this place forever and every little thing you do might be the thing that gets you in the door somewhere. If you get sick of it give yourself a day off, but then you get back on the horse and you keep riding and just sort of keep imagining yourself being that pigeon. And you don't know which one is going to be but one of them is going to get the pallet out.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Alright keep journaling. If there's a specific Distortion at some point. Any one of these it comes up something where you get overwhelmed with self-hatred specifically and Escalades right about it. Okay?\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: And then bring it in and talk about it.\n",
            "Patient: Do you want should I?\n",
            "Doctor: I would love to look at over. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: good morning how are you\n",
            "Doctor: I'm doing okay. Let's see a quick thing about insurance. So Blue Cross seems to be pain up over the rate. They said they would.\n",
            "Patient: yeah\n",
            "Doctor: You saw that too.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know I'll let you finish\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so I mean I don't need to take any more that I'm taking. I'm it's not exactly an air. I don't think for various reasons. At least. I don't feel compelled to let them know. So, I mean my thought was essentially just a credit you or write a check.\n",
            "Patient: that sounds great Since I ask for it back I can give it back.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: The day before you called them. I don't know what the order was but there is the day that we got the letter that denied the request then that day. I got a check from them. Worried about that seems over like what I had expected. How do I approve the request?\n",
            "Doctor: ha\n",
            "Patient: Which is why it wasn't clear to me that you had communicated with them at all and that there was an error. So that's what prompted me to call them the next day.\n",
            "Doctor: ha\n",
            "Patient: But it doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Yeah, so I'll write you a check for what they've done so far and I don't know if they'll I guess I won't be keep doing it if they approved more visit, but we'll wait and see and can I just have like my bank send a check to your house? Is that okay?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Or you can remove it from the check that I'm going to write you.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you're actually had at this point.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I'll double-check but I think that's right.\n",
            "Patient: That's a lot of money that they're giving you then. Okay, it doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: So the party was really great and my speech was really great.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: Can I read it to you?\n",
            "Doctor: Of course.\n",
            "Patient: I wanted to memorize it but I didn't. I wanted to offer some thoughts about what a special person my dad is so as any scientist knows I'm sure most of you will certainly appreciate this after observing a system for a while. You can start to form a model to understand and explain Its Behavior. I will try to lay out a model to describe some of the unique qualities that make my dad who he is. So when I was trying to get some ideas on how to separate this complex system into its component parts actually found myself drawing some inspiration from Dad of himself. He's been building models for complex systems for most of his life. Ajooba. Tell stories of Dad's constant tickle tinkering exploring and building from a young age just this morning without my prompting him. You told me about his attempts just to build an electromagnet made out of a discarded nail and a wire when he was 8 years old and a crystal radio. And this was long before there were kids for that. Is inquisitive spirit is captured by this undergrad thesis for which he designed the model for an Innovative Harvester. Would you actually attempted to build and from my understanding most people didn't even finish their model much less attempt to build one. Do you claim for the accomplishments and potential followed him wherever he went. He Aces entry entrance exams without much preparation. And this is an exam that students now take a year or two off to study for. He graduated at age 21 and was awarded a full assistantship to study in the US in 1978. He went on to study the problems the problem of non-uniformity in tobacco seedlings for his master's thesis in studies took him to the South to study coastal plain Plains farming and then back where he continued his Winding Road and Graduate Studies to the program in operations research. His thesis was on establishing projection algorithms for specifically structured. I have nothing to say about that. He was planting the seeds for an illness lustrous and successful career and no doubt. He loves his work deeply. But most of what I want to talk about today is how my dad by his relationships. Clearly she's a brilliant man was a scholar at heart. But when you ask him about these times, you don't hear much about the finer aspects of his work. You hear about southern hospitality about his first date with my mom his lifelong fear of hiking and snakes and about his basketball games with moms brother's his involvement with the Indian studies associate Students Association. You hear about this Wilderness walks in his Friday Chinese lunches with his colleagues and community. You don't hear about how it was stressful, but I was born hours before a PhD defense you hear about how he went to the hospital gift store to buy a hairbrush for his baby daughter and how you passed out chocolate cigars to members of the defense committee after it was over. Just most of you in this room have experienced. My dad is an incredibly devoted person to experience his devotion is akin to being carried not because he takes over or assumes the responsibility or does it for you? But because of the force of his single-minded focus and wholehearted Devotion to you and the tasks at hand, really? Has a weight of an encompassing you. He takes it on as if it were his own and he takes you on as if you were his own and I'm not only talking about devotion of things that are I'm talking about scrubbing down the trash cans and I local temple every time he goes to during high schoolers in Toms River. I'm also talking about building a gorgeous wooden personalized table for each member of Mom's family and a deeply special and important part of his life hosting his weekly book club of 10 or so, which is now in its 11th year and the devotion part comes in his insisting on maintaining an elaborate tea serving ritual and he doesn't even drink tea anymore. And that's the thing. There isn't a lot of separation between mine and yours for him. He has a way of interacting with the world without a whole lot of Duality. There's not me you self other similarly. There's not a whole lot of happy or sad angry or calm frustration or fluidity. He has a share of extreme emotions, but actually he brings a good dose of equanimity to his wife in this sense dad's way is the middle way and it's great diversity adversity. Excuse me. Dad has Time After Time on the way to find Freedom in. Peace. These are all nice words about his free state of mind. But my dad is a man of action. His freedom has is really born out of a lot of discipline. His day is a series of Artful practices the daily Artful practice of meditation the daily practice of reading the New York Times allowed to his dad. They both have a voracious appetite for reading The Artful practice of a discipline workout routine followed by The Artful practice of a hot tub soak The Artful activist and preparing the morning oatmeal with the right proportion of raisins nuts and dates are full practice of just about 35 physical therapy exercises for his back neck and knees and this is just the morning. There are 20 more at night. There's also The daily Artful and loving practice of being with caring for and learning from his father while this world brings out some of his most tender moments. He also uses discipline to gain freedom in this practice to he gets no slacking doing his 35 physical therapy exercises taking his daily walk or not eating too many sweets and that always keeps his best interests in mind. This is not an easy thing for a caregiver. Not a day goes by when Dad doesn't acknowledge how much he has given him and how grateful he has to be together with him. So what's it actually like to spend time with him? Well, I'll do in this room know. This is just know this just as well as me you actually spend a lot of time laughing. He makes you smile and he really sees the humor enjoy the ups and downs the littles and The Bigs he brings a child likely to the simplest things like learning a new technique for Pomegranate seed extraction digging a hole for a new fig tree. He loves taking calls Worrying about releasing mail-order ladybugs in his garden. He was sick with in the hospital and the big one taking the time resources and energy to ensure that each member of his family can and does prepare these two new Innovative dishes for Thanksgiving. Your purchase each experience as if it were the first time with a fresh look see you spend a lot of time laughing and you spend a lot of time playing learning how to solve problems is curiosity in off of the Natural World of Bounce and his deep intuition for how things and people work makes it really rewarding to go to him with a problem. You learn how to go through adversity. You learn how to treat others and importantly you learn how to care for it and be kind and compassionate for yourself as well. So finally you can't acknowledge this great man without also acknowledging an extraordinary woman the spirit generosity devotion support and humor of my mom have helped bring out the Essences of my dad and my dad is done the same for the extraordinary qualities of my mom. So here's the both of you and may your individual strengths continue to be in service of each other and your community.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: It's a nice speech.\n",
            "Doctor: You're such a loving and devoted daughter.\n",
            "Patient: I needed to say those things. I guess it came out. It came out pretty easily. I had a couple.\n",
            "Doctor: Enjoy slowly.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I had a couple of sitting sessions but I just sort of like used him as the object of focus and then I just wrote it on the day of the party. I had written down like little notes from each session and I use my grandfather and my mom for a couple of days samples. I spent a lot of time going through his master's and PhD thesis but what I really wanted to look at was his Harvester thesis as an undergrad. It's very funny, but we couldn't find it. There are some aspects of the party that were similar to my wedding for me and that Well, some parts were really different like I was kind of a night and day the way that I was like physically not experiencing any any anxiety or tension. I mean, I was a little bit playing in front of everybody. Yeah, is there a fluid and then like once all the people showed up? I found myself stretching myself in right away. Socially, I didn't like my investment took like connecting with every single person there and it was exhausting and I felt it was really similar to what happened at the wedding, but I had the perspective to sort of I don't know take a step back and I don't know likes spent a lot of time with the same people instead of moving from group to group to group 4 hours, which is what feels natural to me and it also made a lot of sense and I was so tired after essentially like 4 days of this because I was so tired just after one day of it.\n",
            "Doctor: That does make a certain kind of sense.\n",
            "Patient: It does but it wasn't obvious.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, no, I understand. It. Just sounds like you worked very hard. I mean happily but\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: the hard\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know why other people don't work harder like why it doesn't try them out. Most people. Don't float the way I do. I mean one extreme is Jeremy who had people coming up to him all evening and he was like sort of in the same general area the whole time. That's how he's comfortable. It doesn't really feel compelled to approach other people but my parents are both Social Butterflies and move from group to group. They don't seem to be exhausted from it. I think I work very hard and I like to myself alot.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're sort of goal or intention is to connect with everyone there.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like in the best most Focus way I can. So I guess I'm like I was thinking about what's going on. In other people's lives like what I can ask them about. Are people really like want to talk? It's not like I'm imposing myself. Like everybody else doesn't feel compelled to be to go around the room and talk to everybody because there are only a few people who know every person so they're like really happy to like engage in a deep meaningful conversation but to do that 25 times,\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think it's solely because there are only a few people who could be talking everyone that you're one of the only people who is that might be part of it though. I don't know. What is I think they're probably something important to how it matters to you to really connect with everybody there. There might be multiple reasons for it, but it seems important.\n",
            "Patient: What is that? I feel. Like I need to show my devotion in interest, but like people need to be reminded. But I'm not going to like approach someone and be like they're like, how are you and I'm like, I'm great. How are you great. I like what you're wearing or something. That doesn't take that much energy.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. How is the trip end?\n",
            "Patient: Right, like I show up and I'm like, how is blah blah blah blah blah. like whatever happened to\n",
            "Doctor: How is your son doing at college?\n",
            "Patient: not even that like whatever happened to your son basketball coach thing. or like\n",
            "Doctor: Like a very specific reference to a previous conversation.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, we're often people people. We're also coming up to me a lot and like a couple of my dad's colleagues like really wanted me to send them a speech which was kind of pretty cool, but You know a lot of people were like, wow, it's so great that you still play saxophone or like I don't know there was just like compliments the entire night. And I also feel like I want to say something meaningful if I'm not just going to say thank you so much, which I did for a lot of people there's also like how did you learn? Like, how does jazz work? Did you know the tune before I hand did you practice or like how did you write your speech like what a great speech is so lucky. And I think I found myself like really trying to reach deeply and ask like, how did I write the speech? I don't know. I sort of like. A whole lot about it. I didn't write much until today and I don't know it's like this whole building the wheel every time or most people seem to recycle a lot more.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's like you really almost maybe even a little bit like scrumptiously try to bring yourself to each conversation.\n",
            "Patient: What does scrupulously mean?\n",
            "Doctor: like with careful attention\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I got like stuck in that mode. I can't pull myself out and zone out. Or like go back to where I'm just like sitting.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you've been very very on.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And enjoying it and into it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: An immersed but also sort of and most importantly not aware of how much energy and effort it takes and how it can Tire you out after a while.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think I realized it kind of a lot later.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, the thought that I had was that. I wonder if sort of given the contacts and given what you wrote how much it's an impart sound up with your relationship with your parents. Like it's kind of like part of how you reflect what they shown you about family. And part of your sort of devotion and appreciation for that.\n",
            "Patient: They don't. We don't show their devotion in the same way. Like they're not trying to make a deep connection with everybody every single time. They talk to someone that's my own way. But I think like in the spirit of\n",
            "Doctor: haha\n",
            "Patient: Like in what kind of spirit and bringing to it?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: If you're not sort of touching your mouth when you offer a suggestion or a or an interpretation your hand goes to your mouth.\n",
            "Doctor: I never knew that.\n",
            "Patient: You have to feel unconscious about it now. But it happens. It's like that's your position for like I made an offer and let's do that. I found out more about my very early relationship with the oldest female cousin. She was there. First of all, my parents think that it was a matter of a couple of days that I was really really sad and gloomy.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I saw remember as feeling like a couple of weeks, but I'm sure they're right. They said that the write-up was extremely painful that was like the worst of it where it was like the transition like I'm being like all my connections are being like cut off completely torn away from me, but that wasn't but that was when I was quite a bit older when I was a few months old her family lived in Virginia at that time, and we would spend many weekends there especially during this time that my mom was from what I understand now very depressed and it was very hard for her.\n",
            "Doctor: I just moved there.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, just moved. My dad had just\n",
            "Doctor: Done his defense. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: just defended. I was three weeks old when they moved and then my mom had never lived away from home and had this new daughter and was like totally depressed for about a year. This is part of my questioning to her like why like she brings it in a way that doesn't focus on the feelings. It's like it focuses on explaining why she was feeling bad. And then what she did she couldn't really do much. It was like she was away from home. My dad was gone. I was like crying all of the time her parents were very preoccupied my grandpa. My grandfather had started a business like as a second career that completely failed and they were losing a lot of money so she couldn't\n",
            "Doctor: What was it?\n",
            "Patient: The business I think it was like a mark some kind of Bodega.\n",
            "Doctor: haha\n",
            "Patient: Is an entomologist.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: He was teaching also but I think he's always had an interest in business, but I don't think he had it doesn't sound like he was a very fruitful venture.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: So they could have talked on the phone and her sister lived like an hour and a half away. So I think that was really important for her to get through.\n",
            "Doctor: Is your dad working long hours?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think he was probably working at least it was an hour commute. She was probably gone at least 9 hours of the day. I mean I don't know. I don't know what his hours were. Okay. Sorry, like got really obsessed with finding my dad's undergraduate dissertation.\n",
            "Doctor: the Harvester\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so I was like looking at the University's web archives. And anyway in the process, I found out that I can look at anybody's dissertation in the whole world and I spent a bunch of time reading yours.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh.\n",
            "Patient: I had to disclose that.\n",
            "Doctor: What were your thoughts and reaction?\n",
            "Patient: Well, okay, so I was like writing the speech and I wasn't really reading it for the content.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: I was reading it for negative deep inside about your personality. In your life and there wasn't really a lot of those. I wonder what my mom infant mother died on the nature of our diet was when I was an infant. It sounds like it falls more until she was withdrawn and I was\n",
            "Doctor: Bussy\n",
            "Patient: spicy rather than her being intrusive in my being whatever. Yeah avoidant just from like what I have heard about what she was going through in that time. And I wonder if she hated me. This is all in the context of what I read. So we would go to her sister's house and Selma was like 9 and apparently she would just like pick me up out of her car seat like strep miadora hip and carry me like that for the entire weekend. She would go from place to place to place and I was like, I was really like her doll. We were inseparable and she was completely adoring and loving and like needed and wanted me to just go everywhere with her. It wasn't like she necessarily played a whole lot with me, but just had me with her everywhere. This was I think many weekends of that first year.\n",
            "Doctor: It is also possible. I don't think this is a comment how she was I don't know but you know some others who are depressed pull it together pretty well.\n",
            "Patient: I think she was probably one of them.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I think relative to the rest of her life. This was the darkest time for her.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But it doesn't sound like there is anything outstanding about how she treated me or how she interacted with me. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. We have about 5 minutes. One thing I'm wondering about is the extent to which you feel a similar kind of pole or sense of being. On and how you would want to talk and connect you. And what you were you would be lost or I think more specifically that like I might miss about you or we might not share if you're not that way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I was just thinking about that, too.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I really do feel that way. I don't know what I would lose. I guess I would. Waste minutes. Like I do feel kind of an urgency here. That I have to fill up all of the time. But if I'm choosing not to that's it should be really important to me. how to lose the chance to show you how committed I am or how special you should think I am. But I don't feel that extra layer of filtering or sensor in here. It doesn't feel like I don't feel like I'm Planning or scheming or anything? It just feels like whatever I have at this time, like should be yours in such a way that you really see who I am and appreciate it and love it.\n",
            "Doctor: Somehow that could happen differently if you weren't his Focus like, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: I know I understand. What you're saying? I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: When I'm getting it.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know how it happened differently.\n",
            "Doctor: I see I guess I had thought that there's maybe something that gets left out a little bit and making the effort. I'm not saying that it's bad to make effort. That's certainly not what I'm saying, but that there's some part of you that gets left behind a little bit. Or judge by you, not quite as good or worthwhile in some way. I think that's the part that isn't involved with trying or something.\n",
            "Patient: I think I get why it feels so scary to not want to try and general and why it feels like that's going to be the end of the world if I fall into. A space where I'm not feeling connected. I'm not feeling Momentum or like not trying. And I think I do fall into that space and it's very bad and scary and I'm not accepting it as much as I accept the other mode.\n",
            "Doctor: It may be irrelevant. But it's just funny how these things come up together. It does make me think of your mom being kind of depressed when you were little and feeling like even she could manage that pretty well and how she was with you that it took effort. You know what? I mean, like how to gather herself somewhat.\n",
            "Patient: What's the alternative?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I'm not going to answer that one. I guess you may be asking rhetorically.\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't. I can't imagine a model of the alternative.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: I think I have to make it. Like figure out what the model is for me.\n",
            "Doctor: We need to stop unfortunately. I'll have to think about.\n",
            "Patient: What?\n",
            "Doctor: I'll have to think about.\n",
            "Patient: You don't have to think about it at all.\n",
            "Doctor: I think I do to tell you the truth. I think it's so that I will shut up and let you talk.\n",
            "Patient: Bye.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Is 90 out there, right?\n",
            "Patient: The heat index is 105.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh my goodness.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: start you start today.\n",
            "Patient: I was there Monday.\n",
            "Doctor: Monday good\n",
            "Patient: I was there Monday. Yeah, it's good. I know some like Facebook I sent out an email whatever whatever, you know, I've got an interest, you know, so we'll see so far so good. I'm going to try to do like a weekly blog, you know that way. So yeah, it's good. I mean it felt good. I was there Monday and it feel like I don't know. I just got comfortable or so weird, but I don't know. Yeah, it's cool. I mean it's going to take time but the fact that I've already gotten some feedback interest questions, you know, it's really good my friend Penny, so I didn't know it was some kind of life coach. She does like wellness her diet, or I don't know what she does but she got in touch with me. She's like, you know, we could totally work together. Like I will refer you to people probably so that's good so far.\n",
            "Doctor: That's great.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, the woman at the Museum where I had my event that Assyrian Museum the director son. I guess he's like 17 17 18. I guess he has like a DD issues or I'm not sure exactly what but she got in touch with me just like, you know, I don't know if there's something you think you could I was like that depends. I don't know how serious it is. But yeah, I don't know. So meanwhile I decided just to just kind of start like I looked into programs courses because I can't afford it, you know right now, but honestly, like I've just been watching YouTube all those lectures are on their, you know intro to psycho-analysis, you know methods of psychotherapy, you know watching those Use me.\n",
            "Doctor: Brazil\n",
            "Patient: Think you looking at their syllabi and I'm going to buy some of the books, you know, I might as well just at least educate myself, you know, I don't know neither mean I'm smart enough to figure out some of the basics until I can actually, you know, take an actually it'll help me that way, you know. I won't feel like I'm playing catch-up with the with psychology Majors. So yeah doing that then I decided what I'm going to do is start a non-profit, you know, the writing remember I was saying why don't I just do poetry workshops. Yeah. I'm going to do that. But here's the trick. I'm going to create a nonprofit that way that way it's not just some poet trying to make money for her. Yeah, because you know nonprofit to make money. They just have to be for a specific purpose or cause or whatever. So what I'm going to do is a non-profit where you know, I'm going to be going to pay myself or whatever we do these workshops whatever but then a portion always goes to like a local literacy things, you know, anything that has to do with like literacy books for schools. Anything that has to do with like writing books literacy do that because I've been researching that and it's fucking ridiculous and I seen some like writer workshops. There's one in San Diego. That's a nonprofit. It's called San Diego. Really nice website. I mean the people that are doing it they're fucking kids for Christ's sake it's not like they can't do it. But I mean that means that I can definitely do it. I mean they're charging like 495 for like a 10-day. I mean come on. So yeah, so I'm going to do that. So I figured between that and this, you know, just a year maybe whatever just kind of really works at it. Maybe it'll start you know, so yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: sounds like you feel excited and\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I do. Like I feel like these two things are very doable. Yeah, I think that's what it is. I feel like wow, I'm doing things like I'm it's an incredible feeling to do your own things. Do you know what I mean? It's like wow. Yeah. I yeah, it's a great feeling to be it. Is that kind of slightly entrepreneurial, you know, it feels great to Just Be Your Own Boss and you know not answer to anybody but yourself, you know, but also do things that I don't feel half asked about you know what I mean? I don't have that foggy feeling where I'm just kind of just getting sucked along into some pass it I'm only got about halfway through or something, you know, so yeah, that's a very nice feeling. I mean that's you know, I don't know and then that grow Luma is here from Delaware. She's here till tomorrow she came to visit and it was cool. I mean, you know, I don't know what to make of her. It's very interesting like yesterday. I think because it's very genuine with her. I was almost like I was feeling very sexual. I don't know. I'm assuming it was bad. Maybe it was like that part of me was like because this feels so real I'm not going to get you know, just shut down or something. I guess. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: not going to you're not going to get what do you mean what? Shut down.\n",
            "Patient: Well like yesterday, wait what?\n",
            "Doctor: I hear what you're saying that it would get shut down, but I don't know your sense of why.\n",
            "Patient: My sense of why because it's like it's not just a sexual thing. It's a real, you know, there's a lot of depth to it. So maybe because of that, you know, there's something I don't know but the things we talked about and you know, it was great. I was very honest. I just told her because I mean we were in a hotel I didn't want to I don't like those awkward. I don't want her to wonder like why isn't he making a move or what? You know what I mean? Yeah, so, you know, we're just laying there very comfy or whatever, you know, we were kissing and stuff and I just told her I was like, you know, I'm sorry like I've been a little bit and it is true. I mean I've been feeling way less sexual, you know. I think I mentioned it in here. Yeah, and I was like, you know, it's just I literally am in a very good way. I'm having trouble shutting off my mind about all these things. I'm doing, you know, I mean, that's just a fact I can't I'm constantly thinking now about business and now about this writing like I'm just you know, so I was just telling her, you know, some of that and some of just I'm not I'm just going through so many changes or something. I don't know. I just feel less it's not a bad thing. I think it's a very healthy thing.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not a very bad thing at all. I think it's just sort of understanding what that what you started to say was because it's more real just as a different reason.\n",
            "Patient: I'm just wondering if that's also maybe a little part of it. I don't know. You know what I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: and by that\n",
            "Patient: Because obviously I've been having not often but I've hooked up with you know, I think it's just because it's functional. You know what I mean? I don't really have to hang out with them. I don't really have to invest anything other than just having sex really and some chit chat. So\n",
            "Doctor: there's nothing complicated.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, so that way I don't have to feel like I'm going on a limb or vulnerable are this or that are like, oh my God. It's a relationship. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: And with her, do you feel that way or you saying like it gets split off somehow when you're taking a relationship seriously?\n",
            "Patient: No, no, what was her? It's like we definitely have a real connection and she's you know, she's like a classy chick, you know, I mean, I don't know how to like she we've done that. We you know, but it's not about that. You know what I mean? This is a real thing, you know girls coming all the way here from Delaware. I mean, you know\n",
            "Doctor: Like you're valuing other parts of the relationship.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: As much if not more than the sexual part right now.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. Exactly. Yeah part of his also maybe self. I don't know not so protected. I mean she doesn't live around. I mean, I think we're both kind of trying to figure out we talked about that last night. It was very honest like she's like, do you ever wonder like what the hell were doing? Like we just talked I was like, yeah I do but I was like, I guess I don't think about it too much because I figure it is what it is. And we enjoy each other's company. We both have a lot going I said in some ways. Honestly, it's kind of perfect, you know, so I was like quite frankly. I'm really just enjoying spending a lot of time alone. I don't see a lot of my friends very often. I've got a little routine. I just need a couple of my Assyrian friends. I do this, you know and other times I'm just really focused on continuing to improve things. You know, that's causing me to want to be alone a lot. You know, I'm having less patience just hang around and like make conversation, you know. I think it's great. It's not in a bad way.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's almost like not being as distracted.\n",
            "Patient: And that's what I told her I said.\n",
            "Doctor: even by sex\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: Which can be seductive and alluring In the Heat of the Moment, but your mind is focused on. More on other parts of your own life right now.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and this was the first time I told the women that very like honestly I just told her I was like, you know in the past I'd always want to be hanging out with people I needed stuff to do sitting rice every way wise. I was like, you know, it was just all folett all filler, you know, it was just all yeah and I was like now I could care less. I look forward to going home and being with Cecilia and cranking up next Netflix and just cruising the internet doing my research. You know, I'm up at like 1 in the morning looking up nonprofits. Like how should I do that? How do I do that? How do I register that or for the business? Am I supposed to be an LLC? Should I you know, what am I supposed to do? There's that someone who's not thinking about boobs, you know in a way it's just become a functional thing. It's not that I don't want to have sex. I don't she's not that kind of girl. I don't want that thing with her, you know what I mean? And she's totally I mean she was like, you know, we're very similar just like I've gone through a lot of that to blah blah blah blah blah. And also I told her I was like, you know, so you lost your dad, you know, so I do want to be like, I think it's good the way we were just not there's no pressure. There's no we have a great time. Enjoy. We don't we enjoy we don't put pressure on each other in anyway. I was like, you know, I know what it's like you lost your dad and even though you're very healthy you're handling things really well, but I also know that the first few years are very, you know, Can be handling it. Well, then suddenly for a month. You're not or whatever. I mean, I just takes a long time so.\n",
            "Doctor: When did she lose? So so pretty recent.\n",
            "Patient: Over a year ago. Yeah pretty recent. Yeah, but I mean she's very grounded. She's a very overall like very together mature cool person, you know anyway so so yeah, but yeah, like I can't lie though. I mean I do kind of like it's weird like I'm almost looking forward to she she's leaving tomorrow so I can just go back to my routine. You know, it's like that's just the way I feel right now, you know, and I haven't told her that, analogy, you know, and it really is like that. I think that's part of it too. It's like if you just fucking woke out of a coma woke up after 20 something years and you probably are going to want a lot of time to just you know, you know what I mean? I I need my personal space and like, you know, I just want to be I don't want to be alone all the time but a lot of the time I want to be alone.\n",
            "Doctor: it's interesting because there's that there and then there's also a feeling of loneliness.\n",
            "Patient: I do I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: Like how those go together.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. They're kind of they butt heads. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean in some ways you may be developing a greater capacity to be alone in a way. It used to be that you filled up the loan with people with sex. It's masturbation or a person or you know, all the holes were just getting plucked so that you felt less alone. It feels like now you're feeling the loneliness more and aware of And thinking about the feeling. It but it's not so intolerable. You have to come outside as much and in fact, there may be some comfort and what you're feeling inside yourself by yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, and also that I mean I told her this too I was like, you know now I'm playing catch-up except now, it feels really healthy catch up. You know what I mean? Now? I just feel like I'm just fucking focused. So you know what? I just don't I don't know. I'd rather be focusing on that even\n",
            "Doctor: like getting your life together and then they'll be room relationship starting to feel like\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, exactly. Like it's not calibrated yet. You know what? I mean right now. I'm just focused.\n",
            "Doctor: this isn't where you land.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, right. Now I'm just focused on making shit happen because I feel like it's long overdue. So that part of me just won't let it go. Like I can't it's not that I can't relax. It's a good thing. Like I'm just you know, I'm excited about things and I just want to see results. I just want to get it going, you know, and I think you have to be that way. I think any people that start to work for themselves. That's 24/7 a lot of times. They're just that's what they're focused on, you know, and especially someone like me I've been pain top, you know exerting energy and all these things like Just you know what? I mean like to finally be focused do Lucid have things that I know are absolutely doable and feasible, you know, that's huge for me. You know what I mean? So it's like I just want to it's like I'm savoring it almost you know, I think the other thing too, I realized you know yesterday there was that I don't know if it's now they're saying it might be a hoax. I don't know there was that story about the 8 year old girl.\n",
            "Doctor: I didn't hear it.\n",
            "Patient: There's some story about an eight-year-old girl in the Middle East who is married off to a 40 year old dude and on her wedding night. She died from an internal sexual things. I was fucking I mean everybody was fucking outraged but I mean I was just you know, but you know, I started thinking about why am I not why am I so outraged but like I started realizing something else and this is maybe why I'm not married also like why I feel like I do have some of my uncle's like I think I've always felt like I'm meant to do something greater, you know what I mean? And for a while I would just focus on music in a Marvin way. Do you know what I mean? But now I'm starting to realize it's not all about that even with music whatever it's about like I just have always felt like I meant to reach more people and somehow affect people, you know what I mean? So that might be part of this whole thing to is that I just some of that needs to be channeled to That's what I'm feeling. I just need to you know, it's important to me.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder what about that story something poignant about the story?\n",
            "Patient: I think it was already this had already been on my mind a little bit, but that was just such an extreme thing. Yeah, I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Like when you connect that with wanting to reach people angry about that.\n",
            "Patient: Well, just because like I was just thinking about how like when children are so helpless 1 Americans are so because I was also thinking about because I went off like I was just like I don't give a fuck what religion or culture you belong to but anything that allows that and that you don't actively try to stop you're just uncivilized animals. I'm sorry. I don't give a fuck what religion you belong to but then I was thinking I was like, yeah, but then that see then the problem is from the states when you say shit like that. That's so quickly. It's just such a jingoistic bullshit. These Packers don't know anything that's coming from someone who understands that most Muslims are totally normal people, you know. The one that made me think about like just seem that's because people don't know. I don't know that just made me think about like connecting to people and helping people just think whatever. I don't know what the specific thing is, but I think that that's music right? All these things are about thinking right. That's all it is. Really, it's not I want people to read my book of poetry and be like, oh I get the sky. It's not about I want them to have their own experience, you know, so I think that's just in general. It's just a general kind of just a way to get people to be critical thinkers, you know, so that's why I was like, well, you know what? It's fucking perfect on this nonprofit, you know, that would be a great way, like maybe part of the nonprofit would be like an Outreach, you know, I can go to schools and talk to kids are weeds and poems or have them right? I don't fucking know something. But those are all ways to help people think about things, you know, but also bettering myself, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's for I also want to make a living and I want to be comfortable and all that but there's no reason why you can't do those things and also do something beneficial.\n",
            "Doctor: And do something that just adjust the drive you feel people understand about themselves.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right.\n",
            "Doctor: make connections\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, and it's funny because that's all it it really has come back to like, how come he never thought to be a psychologist. They really make sense. Now. It's like wow my whole life really that's what it's about. You know. I mean, that's why I feel like I can do this job. Because if you're spending your whole fucking life reading Play-Doh and cameras poet it doesn't matter all these things are about who are we what the hell are we doing? Why do we do these things? What do we want all that stuff? So it makes total sense. Like, you know, I think it would be great to do like, you know, I don't want to do a PhD but it'll be great to do a masters. You know it be fascinating so but yeah that whole thing is part of it that you know, what poetry it's a very powerful thing. It's not just art, you know, like there's a way that you can really get people to think and you know, so yeah. So yeah, so yeah, I mean, it's all good. It's all just like yeah, it is not calibrating though right now. It's an extreme of I can't really shut that part of my brain off, you know what I mean? But it doesn't feel bad. Like I don't feel overwhelmed now, I just feel like all these things are just going to happen and do time, you know, like\n",
            "Doctor: Well, they also start to sound like they don't deal is much like it's feeling like scattered like a little of this and then a little bit and then in the hole.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. No it doesn't it feels like it's all.\n",
            "Doctor: There's actually a coherence what you're saying that we're always around this feeling of wanting to make contact emotional contact with other people that changes them whether it's psychology education culture.\n",
            "Patient: And the thing is now all these things are connected whereas before what's the connection with ESL? You know, like, you know, it's some job this that now feels like this is all like one project, you know what I mean? So it doesn't feel otter contradictory or like I'm fucking tired after teaching prepositions all day and back kind of like I don't you know, yeah, it's crazy.\n",
            "Doctor: Is so often that you would say about where the critique would come in about. Why do I want to teach a bunch of undergrads? Even if you were a faculty member it wouldn't matter to most of them you wouldn't be able to make contact with most of them or just there to check. It off the box like part of what's resonate about that is then where you got to actually affect someone?\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. It's not exactly and now I can do it my way, you know because the thing I don't like about that and said it's still your working within a structure like yeah, I can kind of yeah my own syllabus whatever but the fact is a lot of those kids have to take that class. And so I don't blame them. You know what I mean? I'm not even I'm not there to know to you know, that's one to is you know, again is that you're working for somebody even if it's a great university job, you have that situation and that's okay. I'm open to doing that but like instead of this stuff that I'm doing being a side thing. That should be the side thing. It's all reversed. Like I have no problem teaching in a college. I'll teach like one course whatever to course is fine, but that's not That's just for like pocket money and just to do it or whatever. So I think that's what feels so great. It's like now I don't feel like I'm beholding for some willy nilly though. They offered me a job. I guess I'll take it as a job. I don't know. You know, it's like no it's like, you know, yeah, it just feels like one project now. This is all about the same thing really? So yeah. No, I'm site, but we're more this means I have to do this home equity thing. It has to happen, you know, like for example my websites good but you know, it'd be great if I had you know, I don't know how to do like a really nice like sign up for newsletter. You know, like if I do it it's going to look a little I don't know, you know, it's just like the office you have the project you have to project something, you know people like the website and that's great. But you know, like I know that it could be better and you know, you have to pay people for that so Or even these courses there all these Great Courses at like brown extension. Just fucking pay for it and take a class. You know what I mean? At least I could start, you know, there's some really good psychology courses there.\n",
            "Doctor: That's why I imagine your money would be better invested. I mean a lot of people don't end up if this is what your about they could care less what your website looks like once they've met you and if they think you're helpful. Do you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see. Yeah. Well, that's more just you know, how I am. I just like\n",
            "Doctor: I do.\n",
            "Patient: That's important. And that wouldn't be that much money. We're talking like, you know, 800 bucks 700 bucks, whatever but no, of course if I had that absolutely I was like, oh my God, I can still register. It's right there I can taste it. But that's fine. It's spring. I don't give a shit. You know, that's fine. But yeah, so that's you know, at least if that's in play starting the spring semester. I can start taking, you know, like one class two classes, whatever just you know, I was going to talk about something else. It was on my mind earlier in the week. O you know what we've never talked about in here. I have one OCD thing that I do that I think it must mean something. You know, I don't know how to explain it. I have a habit and I think I've always I can't remember but I think I've always maybe have this I think it probably comes from being so musical but I have this OCD thing where I'll have to have some kind of Melody or just like a snippet of something. I'll kind of like sing it over and over again. Sometimes it's funny but I've noticed in the last few years that like weight was it that when I do that because a lot of times the random pad inside the same are the random words. It doesn't really mean anything. It's just a red nickel rhyming thing, but I pick the same and it's like a habit. It's become like an OCD have it I think and I don't know what the\n",
            "Doctor: and that LCD part being SSA Melody\n",
            "Patient: But it's very very frequent that it's maybe it's not OCD. I don't know maybe a lot of people do this but something about it to me feels like it means something you know what I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: And is it always the same Melody?\n",
            "Patient: What happens is it goes through phases like w Melody that will last for quite a while and then sometimes they'll be some other things but they'll be like one. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: or done it all evolve into something completely different and then that last\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but there is usually generally one base Melody.\n",
            "Doctor: in the melody, what about the melody what comes to mind about it? Is it something you know?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: a song Your Song Song\n",
            "Patient: It's from it's like an Assyrian folk song anything it's hard to explain but it's used in a lot of like a Syrian dances or a Syrian. It's just like a fucking kind and I don't know if it if I started doing that or if one of my Assyrian friends, I don't know how it evolved but\n",
            "Doctor: How many notes what is in that phrase?\n",
            "Patient: It's like a couple of bars. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And then you stop and go back.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's like a loop. So that's one and then I think I've noticed about it is sometimes I do it in a manic way. It's almost like you know what it's like. Did you see Amadeus?\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: Remember there was that really creepy seeing where it's kind of towards the end. Where is the lawn with the candles and he's like playing with the\n",
            "Doctor: Playing I haven't seen it for a while.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, there's a scene where it's nighttime in his apartment and it's for the end. So he's already a little wacky and he just he just kind of starts dancing around his room and just you know, it's kind of like this weird moment of kind of like this. Yeah. It's not quite like that but there's something like that like it's just as Barry semi manic. I don't know what it what that is, but it has to be something. I know. I'm not the only one who does stuff like that. I just don't know what it is or what it means but\n",
            "Doctor: So, what do you think?\n",
            "Patient: I have no idea. It's like a nervous habit or it's a\n",
            "Doctor: Is it when you're nervous?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so. I mean, I think it's just something I do when it's like a filler or something or it's one a lot of times. It's what I'm happy, I think.\n",
            "Doctor: the song A Beat\n",
            "Patient: Like sometimes I do it because the way Cecilia look at me is just so funny. It's just so you know, and she'll be meowing when I get home. She's so excited. I don't know if it's just like I'm an adverse event not manic. It's just like a little burst of energy. I guess. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I don't look my friends just to make them laugh.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, so it's not just private.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's not always private know we'll be walking down the street and I'll I'll just start singing because they crack up and now they know it a lot of them know it so they you know what, I mean, so, I don't know if it's just like if it's just this like exuberant it's like something very deep that I feel that I can't put words to so because I'm musical that's the way you know, it's like if a math person just had a lot of numbers running through their heads or something. I don't know the thing. I can't remember though is how far back it goes.\n",
            "Doctor: As a kid, do you remember?\n",
            "Patient: I don't that's the thing, but I don't even remember if you said like 6 years ago. I don't know. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: The places you were describing with a friend walking down the street or with Cecilia. It sounds like it's joyful, its exuberant.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, a lot of times. It's joyful.\n",
            "Doctor: is it always that is about is that the feeling always with the song or can you also be sad?\n",
            "Patient: No, no, it's never when I'm sad. It's never when I'm angry or sad. It's generally.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a good feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's generally some kind of semi funny. I guess. The only thing I'm saying though is I've noticed even when it is a good feeling. Let's say I'm just driving the cafe or walking to the cafe. I'll just be like I'll be repeating it. That's the only thing I don't you know what I mean? I'm going to become aware that I'm repeating it. So then it feels like kind of like wow. Why do I keep I don't know. I don't know if it's just totally nothing and it just is what I do when I'm having a nice walk to the cafe. Like I don't know. Maybe it's like a\n",
            "Doctor: You keep saying I don't know dismissively. So there's nothing more to know about it.\n",
            "Patient: No, no. No, it's\n",
            "Doctor: There's so much more to know about it.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, okay. I mean it also could be a personality thing. Like we have like that's one of the reasons I love George. You just does things like someone will be walking by and he'll just say shit like we tend to do that, you know what I mean? And this might be part of it part of that. Like I just don't care. I mean, I'm not saying it loudly but you know kind of whispering because I just don't care. It's a beautiful day and I'm walking to the cafe. I don't give a fuk so they could be that but it's just yeah, I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: There could be that not caring but you're also saying you're picking up on this on why the song Why is it only this?\n",
            "Patient: Just a repetition.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not just that you're singing any Happy song walking down the street. It's a particular song that gets repeated over and over and over again. What's the meaning of that song?\n",
            "Patient: Not even the song. It's just I mean, I don't think the song has it's just I just do these repetitive things. It's not always that song. It could be some other snippet or something that I got into the Habit where I'll just repeat repeat repeat repeat. It's just kind of like I just wonder\n",
            "Doctor: Is it hard to stock when it's like that like if you said okay, stop doing that to yourself. Would it be hard to not do it?\n",
            "Patient: Kind of I think.\n",
            "Doctor: Or maybe you've never tried.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's never been to the point where I'm like shit. I have to stop you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, even if it's not a shit, like could you if you just said all right what happens if I try to not do it right now or think about something else?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, I could I think I could yeah. Yeah because for example like when I do it to Celia, I immediately start laughing so I don't I don't even keep doing it because it's so fucking funny and she's you know, yeah, I'm looking at me like hey I keep doing it because she text me up. Yeah, I don't know overall. I think it's a good thing whatever it is.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like being playful.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's very yeah, I think that's what it is. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: the white hearted part the\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah because my friends we do especially with my Syrian friends. There's a lot of that and yeah, maybe because I do that till like if I'm walking down the street and I see someone we just say shit, you know, I'll just start saying shift to myself. I'll start insulting them like in like a Syrian but in a\n",
            "Doctor: Out loud or you mean in your head?\n",
            "Patient: in my head or I might\n",
            "Doctor: Orma Durant\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I just met her at you know, but it's always playful. I'm not like really trying to insult them. Even if it's a woman with disgusting sandals or something. I'm not meaning any ill will it just makes me feel better? You know what I mean? Like, it's just a playful thing. I don't know. I can't explain it like George, you know, a lot of people that come to Christians George just he says chit in a Syrian to to them that are half insulting things, but he doesn't it's just funny. Basically what he's saying is I'm in this fucking place. I have to work 12 hours a day. You know, I'm exhausted. This is my way of making it lighthearted and who gives a shit so, you know, I'll make up words, you know, when someone's salad is ready or whatever just be like, you know. Kimiko I'll just say random shit. That's hilarious, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: And it's insulting is it?\n",
            "Patient: Some of the words he picks their playfully insulting. It's almost like saying what's a word, you know, it's not like hey bitch, you know, but like I don't know. Hey knucklehead. Hey dumbass, you know, yeah, they could be insulting but that's clearly not.\n",
            "Doctor: Definitely not. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: You know, I do the same thing, you know, so yeah, and I think it's related. I think there's something related about that. Maybe yeah, maybe it's just a playful. Maybe it's just something we do because it makes us feel good feel better feel more lighthearted or something.\n",
            "Doctor: And yet it's a particular thing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean even as were saying they don't mean to be insulting. It's also interesting that it's a dumbass. I mean, it's\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Yeah well because that's\n",
            "Doctor: So there is always aggression somewhere inside that kind of joke, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah know it is and yeah, there is with me too. I don't want to see that woman's discussing Footwear, but I think it's a healthier kind of aggression in the sense of like I'm not going to like actually be upset, but I do need to say I need to take a job or I need to make a joke. I need to you know. That's what it is, you know and the same with them is that they're not they're not going to sit there and let these like brown dumbasses with their dad's credit cards. You know what I mean? They need to be like, all right. Yeah, you know, it just helps, you know, I don't know. So yeah, maybe it is kind of like either working class or just feeling like, you know, we have we have to have our own way of maneuvering the world sometimes, you know, I don't know maybe it's an immigrant thing, you know, you're able to have that language. Gives you it's almost like a protective shield because you can just say shh, and people don't know what you're saying. And it makes you feel better. You know, it's almost like a coping thing.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I keep thinking about spirituals for some reason and slavery involving music these horrible things become a way to cope. I know it doesn't have that flavor. It's not a Stark.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but no it's a coping thing. I think. Yeah. It's a coping thing.\n",
            "Doctor: And maybe, you know keeping it light-hearted or keeping it in sing-songy.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly exactly.\n",
            "Doctor: It's better than it really really getting you into trouble.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: Might become a kind of container for all the feelings.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. One thing I always do is like there's a word for like Creek but it's such a funny way. It doesn't have the same feeling that we think of in English. So like I've been in shops and places where I feel like someone's just annoying me or they're just being something like I'll just be like, okay. Well, thank you, you know, I'll just say it. Oh, thank you because it's fucking hilarious and it helps me and immediately makes me laugh and it makes me feel better, you know, no harm no fowl. I don't have to actually dwell or think about you know, it doesn't become a real issue. You know what I mean? It just becomes a way to kind of I don't know. But yeah, I think those things are related. There's something related maybe about those things.\n",
            "Doctor: It's interesting. It's like a secret quiet Rebellion that the person never been knows about.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: But I still get to have a voice inside of you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, and yeah, it's funny because they all do it my other friend Jean, you know. Can uses the word dear you Syrian? Predire so I'll go get sushi or something and he's just hilarious. So, you know, the girl will come up and help you like thank you, you know, like, you know, he just doesn't give a shitt. So yeah, there's something about that. I mean, I don't know maybe I do it because they do it too. I don't know because I've noticed I do it more the older I've gotten in the more comfortable and The more I've gotten tight with them, you know, maybe I realized wow. Yeah that does feel good to do. You know, how do you open this and kind of sass, you know?\n",
            "Doctor: You've been so people-pleasing a polite and differential on the surface, right? I mean to an extreme in a way, dating to other people's needs and worries. There may be a way that even just that you're noticing us more. Maybe you're doing it more. Maybe there's something freeing about being able to actually let those words roll off your tongue a little more. That's about a free Nelson something.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right. Well, it's also probably part of the actual freeing up like you know now I do, you know, if I'm talking to customer service and they're being assholes. I tell them you know, like I'm very you know, who I'm dealing with people in general is much more. You know, I don't keep it in, you know, but, you know, it may be part of the same thing. Alright 1256 Claire. See you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Ramona just to let you know the Monday Memorial Day. I'm going to be out.\n",
            "Patient: What day does that?\n",
            "Doctor: Is the 27th. So two more weeks after this it will be three weeks from now. I'll take a week off.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You're graduating. Is it around then that you're graduating?\n",
            "Patient: Actually, it's on the 18th this Saturday. So I was actually wondering maybe for those two weeks if we could find another time since you'll be away the next week that Monday my in-laws are leaving in the morning, which I don't know if that means I should be around or not.\n",
            "Doctor: So we so we should take off the 20th.\n",
            "Patient: Yes the 20th and then I guess the 27th if there are other times those weeks.\n",
            "Doctor: If you want to take a look next week as it gets closer.\n",
            "Patient: That's fine.\n",
            "Doctor: The reason turkey for me is that that week? I'm out Friday. So at the moment I'm pretty booked solid for the week.\n",
            "Patient: I can probably be okay. I should probably talk to them and make sure.\n",
            "Doctor: Going two and a half weeks. It could be okay for the time.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I can try. I should probably just clarify with them what they're doing anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: If it makes any difference, I might have a time open a little bit earlier in the day. I don't know if that helps at all.\n",
            "Patient: I know it probably would because they said they were going to leave in the morning.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm almost definitely going going to have a 120 time. Would that be better?\n",
            "Patient: That would probably yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so I'm going to put you down with? For them. Do you want to check on check on it and let me know?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, absolutely.\n",
            "Doctor: Where are you?\n",
            "Patient: I guess a little better. I'm done pretty much. I just have to finish up some research hours.\n",
            "Doctor: Congratulations.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks and do my loan exit counseling so that's not too huge of a deal if I know that I was worked up about. I've already got my grade and I got a 97 so that was good.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: That was my main class. So that was good. I had a job interview at the on Friday. So that's good.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh my God.\n",
            "Patient: And then I had sort of another pseudo interview during the week. I say pseudo because she just has to wait for her new job to be secure before her position officially open, but they already asked for my resume and gave it to her boss. So that's hopeful.\n",
            "Doctor: Where is that at?\n",
            "Patient: that's at Walter Reed at the clinic. When I'm more interested in so yeah, it's going\n",
            "Doctor: And these are for research assistantship kind of positions.\n",
            "Patient: sort of the one at the was a data coordinator, which it turns out. It's kind of a glorified data entry person and you don't need a master's or anything for it. The other one is actually a patient Navigator, which I don't know if you know, it's kind of a new thing.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't.\n",
            "Patient: For the HIV everyone at the Walter Reed get screened for HIV and then they would get screened additionally if they're positive for the study and they pretty much have to have almost full blown AIDS or actually have full-blown AIDS and the IV drug users. So pretty serious cases Denison and IH trial is being done in 10 major cities and their three arms of the RCT. And one of them is patient navigation, you basically go with them to their doctor's appointment. You learn about their medications and their side effects you go to are there methadone clinic with them here in contact a lot with them and it's to really be a support system and encourage them to adhere that's one of the arms of the trial that sounds interesting. She also evaluates the program. So it's less Abby and more infectious disease. It was interesting and good. I just have to wait and hear what happens from her.\n",
            "Doctor: It's nice to feel that their irons in the fire in the possibility of things.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was encouraging to have interviews before I'm even done and said that was helpful. I haven't even applied to that many yet. So it feels a little hopeful so that's good.\n",
            "Doctor: How's things been with your senses with your sense of yourself you finish this exam? This is a big deal this transition, but I want to hear kind of wear.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's funny. My mom called the other day and asked I just wanted to know how your interview and your exam went and I told her and she's like and how are you feeling about yourself? Are you feeling any better about yourself? I guess answer is not really which is weird because you would think but not too much.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not that weird. That's why I ask because these other things can kind of cover-up and for the time being makes it feel like the external is going a little bit better. The long-term deeper work is still about your feelings about your own person regardless. The reason is why why is not surprising Ramona it is that you've gotten plenty of eggs in the past for example, and it doesn't touch this feeling it's not like, oh now I am a worthless person and that gets inside now,\n",
            "Patient: Feels like an expectation. In fact, I felt a little silly because I'm old enough, but I told my mom that I was good and I got a 97 and she was like, of course you did. Of course. They let you interview you of course it went. Well. I know how she meant it. She meant it. Like I had no doubt I have confidence in you but it felt a little bit like, it's Baseline. So it's okay. I had a really long week just really really long days. I was exhausted but then somehow Saturday morning by 9. I'm redoing one of the kitchen cabinets and I thought okay, at least I held off I let it go during the week, but the kitchen counter was gross and I could let it go anymore. So I did that. I did one cabinet and the rest of the apartment still needed to be cleaned. I let it go.\n",
            "Doctor: Meaning you stopped at one cabinet. You got one cabinet clean.\n",
            "Patient: It was already clean. I just decided I wanted to rearrange it a little bit dishes and stuff like that.\n",
            "Doctor: It could be all so it could also be that you're human. You're a human being who gets tired and needs a predicate and some time to sleep more and some time to not do as many activities if it stays like that that's a different story. But I also never hear that you get to say to yourself. I get a break till I get a break today.\n",
            "Patient: Saturday and Sunday, I didn't apply to any jobs I kept up with but it was okay. I'm not going to apply to any jobs. It's okay. I didn't do my loan exit counseling either which I can do online which I just want to make myself do today. So it's good but also recognize the part we were talking about like it's never enough. I guess. I'm still waiting to feel to really feel good. And now it's okay. I can get the apartment floor room cleaned, especially because everybody is coming to visit and if I get us all a job offer that I want that I accept and then I have a start date and I finish up these last couple of things that I have for school, then that's good. It's like that's the new I'm like, once that happens. There's going to be something else. So on the one hand, it's probably normal to feel relief once you get a job lined up but on the other hand, it's like there's no moment. I'm stopping and feeling just good about it's done. It's over. It's probably also because I'm terrified of school is over and it does not feel good at all to have it be over because it's all I've ever done is been the one thing for out everything in my life that has been studying and a place where even if it's baseline or it needs everybody's expectations only it still feels good and other people recognize it just being in school with all the work then deadlines and activity. Is it such a productive atmosphere? I guess. I always based my Worth or self-esteem off of doing all of that. And if I may ask my own devices what's going to happen and if I don't have those grades whatever they are, or if I can't obsess over those things to make me feel good or alleviate my anxiety. What am I going to do? I've already gone down the thought process of what if I get fired from whatever job I get which is so bizarre, but it's so typical for me to have a worst-case scenario survival plan in place. I know that's really unhealthy not proud of it. So that's scary for me on top of which I'm pretty scared that once it's over and I start working. I'm really worried that a lot of resentment is either going to be solidified or it's going to really come out especially with Ivan because it's going to be the end of the two-year agreement and he's still going to be not quite holding up his end still really struggling to stay supports a supportive things about what I've done and it's going to be over. There's going to be no room to correct it fix it deal with it and I worry about that.\n",
            "Doctor: When you say the end of the two-year agreement, what's the two-year agreement?\n",
            "Patient: We just agreed that I was going to go to school for two years and we agreed that Ivan was going to work full time for 2 years. That was pretty much it.\n",
            "Doctor: and after that\n",
            "Patient: There wasn't really all those kind of implied before the whole grad school thing happened. It was implied that Ivan was going to be working for those two years and he was hopefully going to be getting started on his PhD or getting its better job and I would probably just work for a while. I really worry about that and it sounds like I can't get over it. I mean I can't evidently and I don't want to be like that. I don't want to carry around this Grudge, but I'm worried that that's what's going to happen. And I'm also worried that and whatever happens with him. I'm not going to have this cool thing. That's kept me afloat to hang on to hang onto and what if I'm not good at my job and what if it doesn't pan out and what is my co-workers don't like me and what if there is no Baseline measure of success. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What if you struggle the way Ivan has?\n",
            "Patient: I feel all of this pressure to either get the perfect job that pays a lot of money or what if I don't have anything for a while and then I could be applying or not applying like he has been and just in this limbo it feels right now like no matter what I do. I'm really scared that it's going to bring that issue with us.\n",
            "Doctor: It feels like those things and how you feel about yourself in this stage of your life and how you feel about him and listen since are so intertwined. It's like you are simultaneously imagine imagining this is going to make me feel this much more critical of myself as well as him. I was thinking the same thing about your quitting school, even though you talk about your childhood a lot of times it sounds like school and I may be projecting a little bit because you haven't said it in this level of detail, but I imagine you were going to school getting homework assignments coming home doing your homework. This is kind of been structuring in the Scaffolding in a way that's giving you a sense of yourself and feels like something that you can hang your hat on that makes you feel good enough about yourself is getting good grades meeting deadlines getting on top of things. To be at this turning point where you're imagining letting go of that as the scaffolding of your positive sense of yourself is terrifying. Who are you going to think? Who are you going to think of yourself? How are you going to think of yourself as an employee at a job where it's not these are grave. There will be evaluations of some kind at every job there are and it's but it's really really really quite different you felt good about yourself or about checking off boxes of school in some ways to me. This is an opportunity to get no to get to know more about what those feelings are underlying because they'll come out in a little bit more without the scaffolding.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm really worried. It also feels like the one place. I've always been where I get recognized for doing well and varying levels, but also all the adults are responsible and there their and they're reliable is an environment where I can count on other people wear. It's a very strict expectation. If this professor didn't get back to you. Just isn't allowed to happen. They have their people to answer to there are all of these other people who are doing the same thing. I guess. It's still supported it still safe. How can going to school be a bad thing? You're doing something really good and productive this contributing.\n",
            "Doctor: It's really it's a really interesting Association to because in a way you're saying that school is an environment where you have mostly gone to count on the authority figures doing what they're supposed to do.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: They might be better or worse at their job a little bit, but they're still going to show up. They have to teach the class. They have to grade your papers. They have to get their grades in or else they get in trouble, right? There's another Authority holding them accountable and that's been so reassuring to have adults in your life. Who do their job.\n",
            "Patient: Like it's a place where people who are potential have to use it at some level. They all have to I guess I feel like my parents and I've been there so much potential and they don't have to fulfill it. I'm also a little scared that it's going to be hard because it's the one area in which my dad to talk. You can talk about school. He can talk about work and that's like it and he's already he wants me to go to vet school. Pretty much. I was pretty bad undergrad. That was my focus.\n",
            "Doctor: He says that.\n",
            "Patient: He would never say that but you still like what about those jobs with I know a couple of people at school Corvette. What about contacting them? It's not something that I'm opposed to but I just feel like he's still really want so I guess it's a little scary. Go about 2 because it's the one area in which he always looks Babe Ruth favorably upon me.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a it's a way you feel like you have contact and connectedness with him.\n",
            "Patient: Right and I'll have that if I get a good job, I will have that but I already feel pressure because he's like now don't take the first offer you get Ramona. If someone does give you an offer you don't have to rush I feel this pressure. I know he probably doesn't mean to put it that way between that and my mother-in-law continually harping on the CDC. I'm just like I really just want to get something and whatever I get I want people to not make a fuss but I want them to have something positive to say instead of always. Okay, but you could have done especially in light of what's been going on. Even if you don't think it's fair or his parents to say he's managing a coffee shop and that's just the way it is, but why aren't you working for one of the biggest organization? It feels like all of All or Nothing it feels But I'm not going to let that work we have it's my job and I'm going to do what I want or what I'm capable of doing. That would be the healthy way to go about it.\n",
            "Doctor: so who this is your father may be inside you what could this possibly feel like with her did he have expectations how did they play out as a kid expectations around job in school bus air pressure from your parents\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's the thing. My parents were never in my entire life asked me or to my knowledge call me to work on homework or study for an exam to have done that would have been an insult. In fact, sometimes my dad even just in grad school if you like. Well, I know you got to study that type of thing which is kind of insulting because coming from them they would just never have asked us to our assignments or anything like that because we were never not going to do them. It's just the way things were.\n",
            "Doctor: Work you and your sister.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You automatically did your work.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: We can take a bath.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I don't feel like there was ever a situation know and I never said like we need you to get all A's or we would love you more if you got all A's, but it was also never a big deal. Sometimes we go to dinner at the end of the school year something or once we did get a report cards, but it's not like a let's go celebrate. They never did that. But my dad did have a tough time the first time I got a D in chemistry test time.\n",
            "Doctor: What happened?\n",
            "Patient: It was just a marking. Grade. It wasn't my total grade. But I done very poorly on the exam and it wasn't because I hadn't studied. I'm still about a chemistry kind of but he was just speechless. He didn't say anything and then there was a parent-teacher conference that came up and he went in and spoke to my chemistry teacher alone and wanted to know what I should be doing. And then he's preparing for the next exam and telling me okay sample ballot questions that your professor thinks the exam is really based on the bus. So you need to be doing these instead. I know he meant well, but it felt a little difficult because I wasn't stalking off that would have been one thing I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: There's no Envy no part in your effort in your working really hard at something as kind of a Paramount thing and the great is really secondary.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I think my dad would never think of it that way because he works insanely hard his dad work insanely hard knowing whatever it would be like an insult if someone asked him to go to work or ask him to apply to a job because it's just understood expected Baseline.\n",
            "Doctor: That's kind of how you feel. When I Ivan's parents are saying things like that to you. Like do they know who I am don't they know? I'm going to get a job and I'm going to do well.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But I guess that's the thing you're describing. It's so assumed. I don't know how to describe this. It's almost like you don't get to get to Applause. If you do well at something it's just taken as a given expectation your mom saying well, of course.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I have a situation in which I got really upset about it, which is really weird for me.\n",
            "Doctor: When you were younger you're saying.\n",
            "Patient: No within the last couple of years my friend Judy from college a really great friend. I really love her. She's wonderful, but we're different in a lot of ways. She did this internship down a Disney. She likes to cook and she did this cooking program for 1 year giant college came back from the internship and she moved in with her parents and she didn't have a job until May and he came back around Thanksgiving and they were totally fine with this because she was like if I had if I take a bad job, I know myself and I want to fight anymore. So they just let her not do any and my parents would never let me this is unthinkable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Where do we start today?\n",
            "Patient: I still feel like I'm stressed. Maybe I'm stressed but I don't know. I'm just afraid to ask my boss about the whole. Hey, can I? Thing, but I did say at work for a full day last week for all three days.\n",
            "Doctor: How did you feel?\n",
            "Patient: I thought okay, I wasn't really panicking or anything like that. My dad's old computer was taking forever and I basically spend an hour or something. That should have taken 15 minutes.\n",
            "Doctor: So bored frustrated no panic when you feel stressed when you look back over the week and you say I still feel stressed. When are you noticing it?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's when I get up in the morning and I have to get myself to work or in the evening when I need to get things done before I go to bed and I'm like, how will have food for tomorrow or have dinner tonight?\n",
            "Doctor: So it's not during the actual doing of the day. It's when you were.\n",
            "Patient: I never stressed at work. I might get panicky at work, but it's not from work is this dress like the preparation and a lot of time in the evening to Wine down and have dinner especially it's like me and Sydney are going to do something and then Sydney panics and then it's like okay. Can I do this myself? I don't know depending on what I'm doing the longer. I wait for him to stop panicking the last time I house.\n",
            "Doctor: So it sounds like what's really making you feel anxious and moments are parts of the day is when you're kind of predicting the future thinking about having to get to work if I have enough time. Will I have time to get this project done? Will I be able to do this thing on my own in the evening? How does it usually turn out?\n",
            "Patient: Sometimes it turns out that I end up going to bed later than I would have liked and I'm still able to get to work in the morning. Sometimes it ends up with me getting to work later. I've never been at the point where I've gone to work and didn't have anything to eat.\n",
            "Doctor: That's good.\n",
            "Patient: I don't think I've ever had to miss dinner either.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that what you're worried about when you're worrying about not having enough time are those the things you're worried about?\n",
            "Patient: Missing in like like missing dinner. Sometimes it just feeling like I don't have any free time and I'm wasting away time doing whatever for Sydney or something. I don't know since I don't have work today. I don't have work again until tomorrow and I haven't had work since Thursday.\n",
            "Doctor: That seems like a long time ago.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess it is usually worried about not having time to eat food or do laundry and happiness clean clothes for work. We end up doing laundry today. Maybe I should go out and shopping because right now there are four shirts that I use for work, which makes me usually have to do laundry once a week if I had more shirts for work and I could Doing laundry every week the same thing would happen. It was just at least happen Okay, I can lend you that day. And that's what I ended up doing last week taking stuff in my laundry bag because his laundry hamper things are really really heavy is there is down to the basement at his place a really really steep. So if I'm doing laundry at his place is a lot easier if he carries them down, but I can carry down smaller amounts of things for myself, which I should be able to do if I have to question actually be dependent on him for laundry, and I'm not\n",
            "Doctor: It might make you feel less anxious because it sounds like a lot of times anxiety stemming from not knowing if he's going to be able to follow through on a plan and feeling dependent upon him even though you don't need to be dependent upon him for that. It kind of sounds like you kind of feel like you are.\n",
            "Patient: Not for that the right now. I'm also looking at making socks for him. There is a skank of two colors and one color is one that I have to use this soon and I haven't been able to find it. It's the second sock. So I wanted to match the first one and I've been looking around his room. I know it's in there somewhere. I'm 99% sure that it's there, but he needs to pay I've been can have some of his stuff but he always needs to clean up in order for me to find that he's like so it will be okay and I'm like it will only be okay if you clean it. If you sit around and just saying that it will be okay.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like some of the anxiety is actually frustration when you say stress. It sounds like it's actually frustration maybe even anger.\n",
            "Patient: And maybe anger annoyance.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, that feels like it fits better.\n",
            "Patient: I guess stealing out of control for I can't really control his.\n",
            "Doctor: You can't control him?\n",
            "Patient: Or living quarters for that matter.\n",
            "Doctor: or his choices\n",
            "Patient: It makes it really hard when I lose things even this morning. He knocked over my glasses. I had them on the dresser and he was trying to find them this morning because I can't see anything without my glasses. He's like, are you sure you didn't put them somewhere else and I'm like, yes, I put them in one of the few places. They are neither. I heard you knock them over last night when you came back in and the lights were off you got annoyed like I was blaming him and I got annoyed that you got annoyed for me blaming him. It was his fault. He ended up finding them obviously because I'm wearing them but that was a very stressful way to wake up in that case. I started was helpless without him because I couldn't see anyting which is why I always put my glasses in a place that makes sense and not like he'll lose his and I always put mine somewhere that makes sense this time. He knocked him out.\n",
            "Doctor: You don't have total control over what happens?\n",
            "Patient: Is really annoying. I guess maybe I should be getting a spare pair but I don't actually have my prescription now then again, I guess it's been over two years since I've gotten you so I probably am due for my guess now that my parents are paying for all the medical stuff. I don't know that I can afford an optometrist. I don't even know if my house insurance covers it so.\n",
            "Doctor: I know what your benefits are. What made these decisions.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I just don't want to have to pay hundreds of dollars. It's not like I'm blind or anything with you. So like Oh, yeah. I said this place is really hard to deal with when it's messy when I can feel the dirt on my feet. And I don't think I'm especially he thinks maybe it's my OCD or whatever but I don't I don't I'm actually especially sensitive to dirt when you have enough stuff on the floor that you can feel it on your feet, especially if you've taken a shower and then your feet are wet and the stuff sticks to your Beach. It's not a good feeling. It's getting harder and harder to deal with that.\n",
            "Doctor: So those are the things that are stressing you out those things that aren't the way you would have them aren't really under your control because you're not going to take responsibility for cleaning his place.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I guess I could take responsibility for cleaning his place. I just don't think it would be a very good idea and I don't think it would be necessary. It would necessarily make me happy. He has lots of big heavy boxes that I can't really move. So I will clean out the old parts of his place, but I'm not cleaning out his whole room.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like it's not really a responsibility.\n",
            "Patient: But then again, maybe it is if I want the room to be a place where I can put my things without losing them like maybe I mean you cannot desire therefore it should be my job.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you think? Are you unique in the desire of not wanting to lose your things?\n",
            "Patient: I guess he hasn't really know he does loses things like check books and stuff I usually end up finding them for him he does want to make his life better he just is doing it very slowly that's all fine and good until I can't find something that I need and then it's a problem\n",
            "Doctor: How much time are you spending at your place versus his?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not really spending any time at my place right now which is another reason that stresses me out like when I'm in the kitchen by myself or something and I'm like I don't live here your roommates are all taking over too much at least 3 days a week I'm only home for a couple of hours that I'm not sleeping my room is sort of like where the air conditioner would go is not working so we don't even have an AC in there I got sick this weekend so I didn't even get to do the whole clothing Purge thing Sydney doesn't really like Aaron so That makes him stress to be there. We usually end up going to his place because it's easier. I think he'll change when I get to my new place. It feels like those roommates are realized it's nice and it's a lot closer to his but they're really nice cat Slayer.\n",
            "Doctor: That will make a difference.\n",
            "Patient: That in the whole not having a gluten-free kitchen means not having to worry about going to a restaurant getting leftovers not being able to keep them up. I still have to hold out until September. It's the end of June. So I still have all of July August if I can hold out I'll be fine.\n",
            "Doctor: So what is it? You think that you can do during those months when you're having when you're technically still at your place to alleviate some of the ways that you have about having enough time or being able to accomplish tasks?\n",
            "Patient: I don't really know other than take one day a week like Sundays to start packing if I'm not sick.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that what you're worried about packing because what you mentioned before is sort of having enough time in the evening or getting to work on time.\n",
            "Patient: I guess if I could cook things on Sunday or Monday, it would take a bunch of work, but I could at least in theory make a few quiches. And then how does Yuki should be my lunch is for that we can possibly also. So I couldn't very cook things. I had my man. That would make the party's easier. I usually still in the morning getting breakfast together slows me down like even if I'm eating in the car if I put cream cheese on the rice cakes the night before then they'll get all sad. I haven't really experienced experimented with I've had I've at least figured out that I'm if I'm going to cut up vegetables it's better to do that at work and take a longer lunch than have that.\n",
            "Doctor: better in the morning\n",
            "Patient: Well, I just that but if I do it before I leave 15 minutes will make a huge difference in the commute. So I started doing that at work that feels a lot better for me.\n",
            "Doctor: Great. So doing experiments like that is really informative kind of figuring out what works for you and things that have been a big impact on your day 15 minutes in the morning making a much longer commute. You're not going to stick with that. So figuring out what impacts you and gives you the best benefit for the least amount of negative impact is something that sustainable\n",
            "Patient: I can hold out until I get to work and eat a breakfast from there. That would also.\n",
            "Doctor: that sounds like too long of a commute though to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm usually Starving in the morning, but I briefly considered it and I was like that's not going to work.\n",
            "Doctor: that's not going to work for you.\n",
            "Patient: It wasn't such a long commute.\n",
            "Doctor: No, but you need to eat to get through that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I kind of need to have caffeine to do it safely.\n",
            "Doctor: very important parts\n",
            "Patient: Feels bad that I'm depending on caffeine.\n",
            "Doctor: I wouldn't worry about it so much.\n",
            "Patient: I was not dependent on it for like a good six years in high school. I was addicted to it but that also because high school started really really early in the morning kind of like now and I'm waking up at 6 and college. I had a couple of classes I had to wake up at 8 or something. Most of the time I could get away away wake me up later even in grad school was not too bad. It's only when I wake up at 6 a.m. That it's a problem.\n",
            "Doctor: So when your life requires you to get up early you need some caffeine in the morning.\n",
            "Patient: I guess that plus the whole can you find commute? It's probably the commute more than anything else. I'm not sure. What would be a good solution for making sure I have time for dinner.\n",
            "Doctor: So when you think back you said there haven't been nights that you actually haven't had dinner.\n",
            "Patient: You haven't been nice that I haven't had dinner.\n",
            "Doctor: So you don't worry about not having dinner.\n",
            "Patient: Author happened nights. I've had to delay it and stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: So what's the worst case scenario for you? What are you really worried about when you're having to delay it?\n",
            "Patient: By having sleep, I guess the thing is it's a nice place. They have the kitchen and they have the living room right next to it with the TV is we usually end up eating in the living room. He doesn't really like eating with his roommate during the living room eating in the kitchen, and I don't like Grossman concealer crumbs on the back\n",
            "Doctor: He doesn't like eating the kitchen when his roommates are there.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Because he doesn't get along with them.\n",
            "Patient: Just get along. I don't know probably also in the summer because the kitchen is hot the living room at least has a fan. I don't know. I guess he's not comfortable eating in the kitchen. So if people aren't in the living room, but it's fine. But if they're in the living room that it's a problem and then he's also too sick to go out or something that we just have to wait one day. I made the compromise of eating in the room, but I really don't like doing that. He thinks I'm kind of crazy for not eating in my bedroom and I spent my whole life pretty much maybe a couple snacks, but I never had meals in my bedroom and I thought that's what normal people do.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds pretty typical.\n",
            "Patient: You thought was pretty typical even though he wasn't allowed to eat in his bedroom growing up. Just like I wasn't he thought it was critical that wants restriction is no longer there that people eat in their bedrooms all the time. I don't know who's not that either of us is right.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, what matters is what works for you? And it sounds like it feels problematic for you to be limited in terms of when you can eat my other people he's got some difficulties eating with other people in the room. So figuring out what's the compromise for you guys then.\n",
            "Patient: really isn't a good one other than maybe going out but then if you can't go out that's not a compromise either like the compromise isn't really that we do something in the middle that will make\n",
            "Doctor: I think trading off who gets their way might be a compromise you get your way this time. I get my way next time or not eating together.\n",
            "Patient: Except that then if I'm at his place I'll feel uncomfortable eating in the kitchen by myself because I don't live there and that feels weird to people are around that doesn't really work. I guess I have to decide which is worse in the kitchen when there are people around when I don't live there or Sydney isn't there and it feels like it's less valid for me to just be there by myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Or spending more time in your place.\n",
            "Patient: Or spending more time at my place.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not spending time in your place because it's less comfortable.\n",
            "Patient: there's never anything to eat in my place now that And Amy are gone Aries. Aaron is on grocery shopping. There's maybe a box of pasta in the downstairs area when there should be all the pasta. So Aaron isn't really been keeping up eating at my place would require a lot of planning and stuff and it doesn't really work when I just gotten home from work and it's like oh, yeah few hours. Yeah. That one is a problem. If I'm going to spend more time at my place. It would probably be on the nights that I don't have to work.\n",
            "Doctor: So it sounds like a lot of your stress is coming from this question of when is there going to be dinner? Where is there going to be dinner?\n",
            "Patient: Not always a problem. I guess I having a bunch of times in the last couple weeks.\n",
            "Doctor: But you don't know when it's going to be a problem, which is what stressing you out your matching that it could be a problem because it has been a problem. You don't know when because it's kind of a is kind of dependent on where his roommates are would you don't have control over?\n",
            "Patient: No, I really don't want of them is a PhD student. So sometimes she's never around and then sometimes she's always around one roommate doesn't use. Other three sometimes you win sometimes. And then I'll watch a show and then I'll end up being there for three hours watching many shows.\n",
            "Doctor: What's the discomfort with eating with the roommates?\n",
            "Patient: Vermeer for him\n",
            "Doctor: I guess I'm interested in both.\n",
            "Patient: Really? It's like if he's there it's nothing if he isn't there, it's me, not living there and feeling like I'm taking up their space.\n",
            "Doctor: Has there been expressed unhappiness with the amount of time you spend there?\n",
            "Patient: There was once several several months ago, but that was before they knew that Sydney had serious depression and that he's explained it to them and that they were okay with it, I guess for me. I'm like, okay that was several months ago. I'm not sure if they're still okay with it under the understanding that I'm taking care of him. And then I'm thinking maybe they're thinking why is he not better yet? Why is Georgia still around since I don't know that I haven't talked to them about it. I don't really want to talk to them about it because I don't want confrontation and he says it's okay. That doesn't really help me because I'm not looking for him since it's okay. I want to know whether or not his roommate. I don't know. He doesn't need his roommates or anything, but I guess it's the social anxiety thing not wanting to be around anyone or not or anyone but me that makes him not want to eat.\n",
            "Doctor: Has that always been the case for him that he's had that level of social anxiety.\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so. I don't think it was the case before he was depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: It's come along with the depression. It does sound like he's really avoiding being in the presence of others and he's kind of almost hiding in his room eating meals.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, what she could do that for me. It doesn't really.\n",
            "Doctor: You can do it because he doesn't feel uncomfortable eating in his room, but it does seem problematic that he's feeling the need to retreat so much and it's uncomfortable for you feeling like well when it's uncomfortable for you to kind of break this rule Pierce off of eating in the bedroom, but also because you're kind of being forced to hide as well. It doesn't feel good to hide in a place where you're really living.\n",
            "Patient: I know because my place seems unlivable to I think I just have to hold out for another two months until September.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like to feel comfortable in a place you need to hold out. I wonder if having a conversation with his roommates might put you at ease to know what they're really thinking.\n",
            "Patient: I kind of really don't want to because I'm just afraid what would happen if they say, oh actually we're really pissed that you're over all the time. That's not much I can do that.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you could ask. Is there a way to make it more comfortable?\n",
            "Patient: maybe but\n",
            "Doctor: If that was the case, you don't know if they're really pissed. But if they were is there something you could do to ease that?\n",
            "Patient: other than spending more time at my place which again would require this planning or have stuff to eat because it's not like you've given others anything to eat, which is really annoying.\n",
            "Doctor: Who does the shopping for food at Sydney's place?\n",
            "Patient: Everybody has their own shopping. So people have different shelves on the fridge that are there.\n",
            "Doctor: So when you do the shopping, could you stop a few Necessities just of your own that your place that wouldn't be shared?\n",
            "Patient: Is there a the problem in theory the problem is that certain things? Like if I have pasta I really want to have cheese on it if I have cheese and I actually can bring it to my house because I have to go down to Hampton. So it's not like I can just\n",
            "Doctor: So you wouldn't be able to have everything there.\n",
            "Patient: Why would be my easiest meal other things would take a lot more work like practically all males? I could stop process that would be fine and right George on it, but I have to go to Hamden if I want anything to put on it getting vegetables. You can't get them that far as anything else. It would still require planning of Sydney wound up going to my place and having things for the morning and everything.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it feels complicated.\n",
            "Patient: It is the gluten-free kitchen is probably the most complicated factor that plus Aaron not really doing his job of getting food for the kitchen.\n",
            "Doctor: And it's very complicated and it feels so uncomfortable at his place.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so really the only solution I can think of is to deal with it until September when I had a feel at home in my new place, but that still means two more months of this I survived is so far, but it doesn't really make that any better.\n",
            "Doctor: How aware is Sydney of the impact on you?\n",
            "Patient: I told him about it before he knows that I don't feel comfortable being there without him.\n",
            "Doctor: Candy challenge himself to help you to be out there more with you.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know maybe maybe into degrees he could I don't know if it would work out sometimes when he gets that depressed. He keeps on saying that he thinks he can't do XYZ things that I think he can do, but I'm not him. I don't know if it is a cop out or if it's he thinks his depression makes it so he can't physically do whatever saying and I think his depression is telling him he can't do that thing, but he could get around it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, sometimes it almost is reinforcing certainly the fear has its seed in there and then he doesn't do that thing until it started brand prices in his mind that he can't he probably feels a little bit of Anxiety Relief when he avoids the things that he's afraid of that he might actually feel better. If you could confront some of those fears and see that actually he is more capable than he believes himself to be.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I don't want to make those assumptions for him though.\n",
            "Doctor: United Sara pist those are things that he needs to be working on with his therapist.\n",
            "Patient: Again, there's not much I can control in that situation.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, you can't control him or his choices or how far he can push himself but it does sound like in some ways you're being limited by his worries his fears. And then they're feeding to your own worries and fears. You want to separate yourself in some ways so that you can be independent of what's limiting. And right now it does sound like a lot of your worries are coming from not being able to control him but feeling controlled by his depression.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that sounds about right.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's I think it's important that you're not controlled by his depression.\n",
            "Patient: I need time in the day to go to Hampden and make my room and have it. I had to move a lot of things around for the new windows that they Never talk to us really before he was doing at you like oh by the way, the guys are coming in to measure the today and they're coming in to install this on this day. I'm like, you should really spend that money changing that door between mine and Ryan's room in a walk, but I didn't actually say that\n",
            "Doctor: It does sound like it's getting really uncomfortable in your house, too.\n",
            "Patient: there's a reason I'm not there all the time. I was there on Friday to get some errands done. I think we're going there tonight so I can be there because I have to book tomorrow morning. And obviously my address is still my place. So I need to get down there to move before work. I think what we'll do is have dinner before we go there that's off tonight, but that isn't the rest of the week to go shopping Hamden or something like that. But I'm the one who has the car when I'm at work that makes things harder to I guess you could take the T in theory and get there and get back, but it would be a big pain.\n",
            "Doctor: And there's no gluten-free Market in between here and work.\n",
            "Patient: There is not a gluten-free Market between here and Cheshire. They sell a lot of things that are gluten-free and grocery stores or rather. There is this one symbol that appears on a lot of cheese is that my house isn't practically speaking I can get ricotta a soft cheese has some of those will actually have a symbol that my house except those I can get at regular grocery stores. But anything else I need to go to Hamden is the closest place that will habit which is really frustrating.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I can understand your frustration and it's challenging.\n",
            "Patient: He was complaining about how his new job was going to have such a long commute. It's all the way out there where you see the signs on the highway and I'm like, oh like that's a third of my commute. I do not feel bad for you at all. Really? It does come down to not having enough time for that and still have some dinner and I'm only gotten tiny little minor things. I haven't really gotten to anything later yet.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you have two months.\n",
            "Patient: How 2 months I've taken June off and I think that will be a good problem. Maybe I'll be regretting that decision the end of August.\n",
            "Doctor: Perhaps between now and then thinking about what it is that really needs to get done and setting reasonable goals in a timely way. It doesn't make sense to pack up everything now. There may be things you need but thinking about what needs to get done and what can get done.\n",
            "Patient: Considering I don't really go over to my place, but I'll find I have enough clothes live off at Sandy's place. That would mean that anything that's in my room could be packed right now because I need it that badly it wouldn't be in my room.\n",
            "Doctor: So maybe thinking about sections of your room and doing a chore and getting a section done by this time by the next time and setting that time frame of those eight or nine weeks. However, many weeks it is before.\n",
            "Patient: Bible Hub a little bit. I think last time I did move it actually did only take me a day to pack. I had a lot less stuff than I have now at night.\n",
            "Doctor: It will probably take more time.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's all that stuff. Like yarn shouldn't take that long. I don't see what else would be so big other than all that yarn for my store and all that yarn is in big bins in the basement. That's pretty much packed up.\n",
            "Doctor: So that can just move the way it is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I guess the. I spotted a dyna bunch of yarn and using my stars and I can make that more flexible.\n",
            "Doctor: That sounds like a reasonable thing to think about and maybe setting aside time to do that dying.\n",
            "Patient: Who's responsible up until the point that maybe those colors might not all go together. And then if I have to mix up other colors usually end up with more empty containers and I started with I guess I was really purposeful and I don't care if I made a really ugly color combinations I could do it.\n",
            "Doctor: You probably care about that though.\n",
            "Patient: Is it bad that I'm using it for then again? If it's ugly then there are some people who like really weird color combinations that I know so as long as somebody can use it.\n",
            "Doctor: As long as it appeals to someone in your audience.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so that's not actually as bad. But if I'm doing more specialized things where I need certain colors, and I'm thinking about doing that before I move. I guess I'm doing it soon enough. I don't know. I guess the worst case scenario is going to die. But I'm using an East Coast thing. So if I had to put out 15 bands of different colors and rinse them out, it wouldn't be that big of a loss.\n",
            "Doctor: Sometimes when you're packing up you have to erase some stuff.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I think if I had to do it, that would be a big deal. I think it's just the fact that my room isn't my light green eyes is probably with making it seem like such a big deal if I can just put things in the bins and contain them then maybe it wouldn't feel so bad.\n",
            "Doctor: So is there a project you could do on a day that you're home this week? That would help you feel more organized or more prepared?\n",
            "Patient: Maybe there's a smaller been in that my mom gave me that's in the back of Sydney's car and I guess for all the Yarns that are sitting around I could put as many of them as bit in that container and there will be that much fewer yarn calculator. I think I could continue and I believe that I wouldn't need any of those four projects anytime in the near future or just make sure that I have lost that I I'm not working out anytime soon.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe that would make you feel better. That would be one project. You could get done reasonably quickly. It sounds like.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I can probably do it on Friday. As long as I don't help for I'll maybe I'll do it. I'll do more after that because if I start doing. I might get too disappointed if I die.\n",
            "Doctor: Set one goal and that's the goal you check it off and you take a deep breath and you feel good about it. And then you said another girl the next time but you don't change the gauze you're working on it.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, that's the part that feels really hard because I'm like, oh I should be able to pack up everything.\n",
            "Doctor: You can't do everything at once, but you can set one go do it and let go of it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's true that someone change the whole evening getting food situation.\n",
            "Doctor: It doesn't sound like you don't feel like you can do much to change it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's doing what you can to manage the anxieties that you have control over and it sounds like with the dinner situation. It's really about seeing if you can separate a little bit their control that the depression has on Sidney versus the control that his depression has on you and allowing yourself some independence from his depression.\n",
            "Patient: It also doesn't say that I couldn't go out by myself. Other than now I'm spending all the money.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe that's worth it on the nights that the option would be eating very late or eating in the room. It doesn't mean that you're making a decision about every night but making a decision on this night what works best for me if there is a night where you're able to do what works best for him. That's okay too, but not always feeling it has to be with working best for Sydney. Is there anything else that we should be catching up on our talking about today that we have it?\n",
            "Patient: I guess the weight loss thing. I didn't take a break in terms of eating vegetables one day. I had a fruit or a vegetable.\n",
            "Doctor: it has to be a choice to\n",
            "Patient: My lunch is all 30 days of work.\n",
            "Doctor: how did that feel?\n",
            "Patient: That's all good. I needed to go to the grocery store and get stuff for so we can have those things on the days that I'm not having Works did he apparently is losing right now just by eating and I don't know what he did but he was like, oh, I love you. I'm worried that I can't do the same thing. I don't know what it is other than I guess you was doing a lot more overeating and I was when he was super depressed and now that I guess that isn't true. It's actually working you feeling less depressed and I will order last ridiculous things for 1\n",
            "Doctor: It's not a competition between you and Sydney.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's not. I just don't want to be this overweight. I guess it's just discouraging that he can do it without seemingly little effort.\n",
            "Doctor: And that it's taking more effort for you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I can understand that it feels frustrating.\n",
            "Patient: Serena and I'm adding the actual to my diet. Should that be helping I mean, I guess that's helping eating healthier, but I might not be helping.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you replacing something? Are you using the vegetables to replace something else or are they in addition to what you were eating before?\n",
            "Patient: I think they're replacing in terms of I can get away with less other things like it would normally be that if I got one of those microwave Meals one thing by itself might not be enough always fruit it is or pieces of pizza. I will eat less slices of pizza if I'm having fruit with that then if I'm not\n",
            "Doctor: And that's really the idea because you are a plate you are replacing something. That's probably better for you if you are calories.\n",
            "Patient: At least even if I don't get a coffee drink in the morning if I'm high. Rice cakes and I'm not having a cookie with it. So it's a healthier choice. But at least one alternative even if I'd gone to get coffee. I don't have a donut with it. I'm assuming a coffee drink has less but it's not less fat than a donut. I don't even know.\n",
            "Doctor: You'd have to look it up. They usually post that information somewhere on the website. So you can check that out get a sense. I'm not saying count count your calories because I would prefer that you be going by whether you feel full and do you feel like you're getting a good variety? Sometimes it is informative to get a sense of how many calories is in a donut. How many calories is in a coffee drink? Sometimes you might be way off base from what you're guessing.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe they'll I'm at least eating less Donuts than I was so I think until I get less stressed. I might continue with the drink.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not saying what to eat though, but sometimes get an idea so that you have a ballpark idea of what you have.\n",
            "Patient: Like how much of my days calories if it's like 50% of the calories?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, just to know your limits just to be armed with the information.\n",
            "Patient: I definitely looked it up many many years ago and it might have changed if they put different things in it and stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: So are there ways that you can snack sneak in maybe a little bit more activity into the day. It sounds like you've made some healthy changes with regard to what you're eating and the other way to burn calories is to find activity that you can sneak into your day.\n",
            "Patient: Even though it's really hot. If it doesn't take forever for me to do stuff at the bus stop like walking around for a bit until Sydney is out of his therapy today yesterday actually in the evening. I walked for 1/2 and intended to be a small trip and then I stayed out for a half an hour. I was walking for most of that.\n",
            "Doctor: Those are good ideas. Yeah on a really hot day like today even walking outside for a bit. But you can also find ways in an air-conditioned building take the stairs things like that so that you don't feel like you're uncomfortable out in the heat, but you can still find ways to walk indoors where it might be air conditioned. It sounds like you're being more aware keep plugging away at it.\n",
            "Patient: I haven't even looked at the scale in a week or two and I don't even know if I want to look at it.\n",
            "Doctor: And you don't need to weigh yourself very often you could weigh yourself once a month just being aware of the choice that you're making. You have your goal of one yarn box.\n",
            "Patient: Friday\n",
            "Doctor: for Friday\n",
            "Patient: We're not meeting next Monday. I think it's the first.\n",
            "Doctor: I have us not meeting that week and then meeting the week after which is the 8th at 2:30. Okay, so we'll set another goal that day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hello there. I'm one of the new physicians in the practice. First of all. What would you like me to call you?\n",
            "Patient: Oh June sign.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, right. So what is it about that brought you to see me today?\n",
            "Patient: Well, it's the same thing that I've seen Doctor Jones about it's my heart.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah, I understand that. You've been in to see him a few times over the last few months. Would you mind if I asked you to go over again what the problem is perhaps in your own words so that I can get an understanding of it.\n",
            "Patient: No, not at all. It's just I keep getting these situations where my heart starts to really really race. Like boom. Boom, right I get chest pain. I can't catch my breath. It's making me feel feel funny talking to you about it. Right and so my heart starts to race. I can't get my breath and then I get chest pains and I get very afraid. I'm going to have a heart attack.\n",
            "Doctor: Right and you're feeling a little bit anxious just here with me.\n",
            "Patient: I am okay. Yeah, just talking about it. I can feel it starting to come up.\n",
            "Doctor: Right take your time. So your heart starts to race. It really beats fast. And you feel like you can't catch your breath. Is that right?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's exactly it.\n",
            "Doctor: How long is this been going on for?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's probably about six months. Basically. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. Okay, and can you remember what happened to start it all off?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I think we've had some problems at work. I've felt more stress about work than I normally do and basically I was just trying to get into town one day on a off day and it was very hot. One of those funny hot days. It just happened my heart started to race and race and race and I couldn't get my couldn't get my breath. I was just like gasping for breath. Then I started to get chest pains and it was just awful and I'm managed to sit down and call my husband and he came out. He actually left work to come and get me.\n",
            "Doctor: Laugh sounds like quite an unpleasant experience for you at the time.\n",
            "Patient: It was awful it really it was really really frightening.\n",
            "Doctor: And when was that happening to you? Oh and when that was happening to you when you were in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on?\n",
            "Patient: I thought I was having a heart attack. I am only 25.\n",
            "Doctor: You thought you were having a heart attack?\n",
            "Patient: I really did. Yeah, and each time. It happens. I'm so afraid that that it is that is what's happening.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: So, you know, I started to try and avoid situations where I might get like that basically.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. So what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?\n",
            "Patient: I can't get into town now without my husband taking me cuz because my husband has to take me to and from work and I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all. So I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment and other things as well.\n",
            "Doctor: And other things what sort of other things are you not doing?\n",
            "Patient: Well, just some personal things.\n",
            "Doctor: Personal things okay. I guess I'm wondering if you're talkin about your sex like there.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, right. I just feel that I shouldn't, you know do anything like that because it might put too much strain on me.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. So you're avoiding sex and a case that it puts your heart rate up.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, how's that affecting things between you and your husband?\n",
            "Patient: It's not I mean, yeah, my husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest doctor. He's been really really kind and really supportive but I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot. Now you wanted me to go to the pub last week and I absolutely promise that I would because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's going to happen and I promised and promised him I go to the tub and then know when it came to to it, I just couldn't I just sat on the sofa and it started happening to to happen again, right? And then I was worried if I went to the pub I'd actually get it'll in the pub and then it'd be really embarrassing for everyone. So I just Said I couldn't go and I think he's getting a bit to the end of his tether now because it just seems to have come out of the blue and I've never suffered from anything like this before.\n",
            "Doctor: So it sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether. But it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well. Is that right?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I am actually yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so just so that I've got the story straight this all began about six months ago before I that had you had anything like this.\n",
            "Patient: No, not at all. I mean, I think we had a new manager at work. I work in a bank actually and then we had a new computer system put in so it became much more stress stressful for all the staff not just me and I can sort of see you. I was under a lot of pressure right that could be affecting me.\n",
            "Doctor: So just to make sure I've got the right way around it if you can 6 months ago pressure work.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You went to town you had the first of these attacks and then since then you've had some more of them.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And now it's kind of got to the point where you don't want to go out.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: You don't go out to town by yourself.\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't want to risk it to be honest.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, you're not going to the pub. You're not socializing like you used to.\n",
            "Patient: No, no.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and that's having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship.\n",
            "Patient: It is a bit. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Okay. I'm looking at you. I know you've had an ECG.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What have you been told about the results of that?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I was told that it was okay and there was no problems and you know, I did feel relief, you know, because obviously there has been heart attacks in my family. My dad died of one, you know, I 72 so I'm thinking of must be my heart. There must be something wrong with it. Right and I did feel pleased with the doctor said that but on the other hand nothing's changed, you know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems right? Nothing. You know, I'm not getting any help with it. I just feel a bit like well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the symptoms and they're getting worse and worse.\n",
            "Doctor: So even though the doctor told you there's nothing to worry about with your heart. Do you still worry that there might be something wrong with your heart?\n",
            "Patient: I do. I just can't understand it. What do you think? It is Doctor?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I think I'd agree with the doctor. I don't think there's anything wrong with your heart. The reason I say this is that you had an ECG which is come back perfectly normal. And usually if there was a problem with the heart that you said you would pick something also you got none of the risk factors really for heart disease because you don't smoke your blood pressure from what I gather from your notes has always been fine. You're fairly young before this you're pretty sitting active. And also I know you're worried about your dad haven't had a heart attack, but actually he was a lot older than you are and so you're not really in the same respect as he would have been so I don't think that there's a problem with your part. I guess what I'm wondering is whether actually what's going on is a little more with the doctors thought weather actually. This might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms. Have you ever thought it might be something else rather than a heart problem?\n",
            "Patient: I think I've been thinking more recently. It could be because my friend has panic attacks and I've discussed it with her and she said to be honest. It just sounds like that. I've always thought it was my heart and what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like\n",
            "Doctor: Right. Okay, the anyone explain to you about anxiety and panic attacks.\n",
            "Patient: Not really. No.\n",
            "Doctor: What we have on top of our kidneys is to little glance and they're called her adrenal glands, right and they produce a hormone called adrenaline. Have you heard of that?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I have heard of that.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, and when adrenaline does is It prepares us for situations of fight or flight. Is that a Charmy perhaps remember for biology at school?\n",
            "Patient: I do I do. Yeah, I do remember that.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you remember what we need my fight or flight?\n",
            "Patient: I think like if you're in a scary situation you either fight or run away, basically.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, your body starts of chiggers. To do it. That's exactly it and what's released to allow you to do. The fight or flight response is the adrenaline right? So when your body needs you to get ready to do something it searches out of a lot of adrenaline and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action, right? So it does things like a guess your heart rate up. I guess you're breathing speed up so that you're ready to run and can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry. It can sometimes make people feel a little bit light-headed. Are those the kind of symptoms that you get\n",
            "Patient: yeah, definitely. Definitely all those actually\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, what often happens with people with panic is that the first time it happened the first of gentle and release occurs out of the blue and perhaps it time to stress and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work you feeling a bit stressed out and in town. It was a bit hot. So that may have been what it was behind that first attack. What happens if people is that once they've had one panic attack, they're going to have more and the reason that is that once you had something like that happen to you. You're kind of their thinking will this happen again? Is that something that you do?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, absolutely. I've started to really monitor monitor my heart and when it starts to race I start to get worried and then it starts getting faster and faster. So it does feel.\n",
            "Doctor: You're describing it exactly. That's what we call hyper-vigilance. So you're their kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, definitely.\n",
            "Doctor: And for most of us are heart rate will go up and down all throughout the day but most of us don't worry about it because we don't notice it but because you had a panic attack your there thinking what's my heart doing?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And then there the minute it starts to change you clock it you notice it and then you start to get anxious thoughts. So you might start worrying.\n",
            "Patient: I really do start wearing. Yes. So I keep thinking it is going to be now, you know, you know is my heart going to stop breathing.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, so you get these kind of anxious thoughts.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And they're very frightening. And because you're thinking Goodness Me could my heart stop that's making you more anxious and that causes even more adrenaline to be released and that makes the symptoms even more pronounced and that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you. Does that make sense as to what that might be happening?\n",
            "Patient: It does make sense doctor.\n",
            "Doctor: One of the things that you have been doing which is something a lot of people do with anxiety is that you started to avoid doing things that trigger at all.\n",
            "Patient: I have ya like not walking to town or anything. I just won't do it anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: Exactly and Willis in the short-term that alleviate your symptoms because you don't have to get panicky what's happening as at the more you avoid to do things the less likely you are to ever get around to ever finding out whether or not anything really happened.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Yeah, right.\n",
            "Doctor: Does that make sense?\n",
            "Patient: It does it does make sense.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, if we are starting to tackle this as if it were an anxiety problem. The number of approaches we can think about tables we can think about other kind of talking approaches. There are pros and cons to those and side effects that we need to discuss. So I'm just slightly watchful of the time. We seem to be coming to the end of today's discussion for the appointment.\n",
            "Patient: Alright, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: What I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week and look again more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best. How would that sound?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, that's fine. That's fine.\n",
            "Doctor: Any other questions before we finish?\n",
            "Patient: No, I'll make an appointment to see you next week.\n",
            "Doctor: That's fine. I'll see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thank you doctor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: Morning, I'm at a loss as to what to talk about again. Although I think in a better way this week in general. I feel better this week than I have for the last couple of weeks. That is a good thing. The classes are not immediately obvious, but I think some of it feeling like I have been telling people that I'm upset and trying to deal with that in I guess different drugs fashion. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not sure where to begin. So it's a strange thing, not know what I'm asking to consult with you on but that's where I am.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think of it as a session to session but I think of it as what you framed what your are asking for cans consultation on this is part of the process.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Well, thanks. That's helpful. Yeah, sometimes I'm not sure what what thread is important to pick up this week. I guess my parents are coming to visit this weekend. It's probably a good thing. We have a very small apartment. So I'm concerned about hosting my parents in our tiny apartment. It's they have a house that's large enough for 7 people that live in and our use it. Are you living in that space and it's a different thing.\n",
            "Doctor: I may have come to visit before.\n",
            "Patient: I didn't tell him visited me since I was in college in Texas, so it's an interesting and different thing. I was in Ohio for 4 years and after a couple of years, my mother decided that she might want to visit instead of just me coming back to visit which in a lot of ways made more sense me visiting home because the rest of my family is there it's one person far away and six people relatively close the direction of travel make sense for me to be going back home. But that's what my mother decided she wanted to know what I was doing and was curious where I was and all of them know here in Andover that's not really going to happen because I was doing all the actual work. Now I'm sitting here. So I was thinking about how good a question that was that you asked. It seems to get you a lot of issue. I think they haven't visited before and so to a large extent. I have no idea what to expect. I think we discussed that generate some anxiety for me.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it anxiety that there are particular scenarios you're worried about or is it just sort of really Amorphis?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's generalized. It's no particular thing that I'm worried about other than there's no particular thing. I'm worried about. Just a general feeling of unease about it. I think there's a sort of a sense of Hosting responsibilities hosting then that comes with sir and sort of make sure everyone has a good time sort of goals or requirements or something. I'm not particularly clear how to do that in this context. Not that my parents are hard to please. That's the silly part of it. It's like the ridiculously easy going for the most part and if they're bothered they are not going to tell me so it'll be okay. And they're coming explicitly to see us and to like help the care of us in this difficult time. So it's so I think that's going to be okay. Over the weekend and I guess until Monday 20th seem to be getting a little more sad and sleeping more and kind of strange and I found out Monday that she had run out her Synthroid or synthetic thyroid hormone. I think I think I stopped taking it Friday or before so why do I don't know or think that that is like a primary driver of her depression and just all of the turmoil or the last couple of years. She didn't have a greater and part of her thyroid removed and has been doing thyroid suppression therapy since about the time we got married so it fits right into the same time under as everything else.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess me one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism is increased anxiety and one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism is tiredness and depression for a while. I didn't remember if I told you this but a while she hadn't had the thyroid nodes checked in months and finally did get them checked when she had hyperthyroid numbers, which is a result of essentially taking too much of her thyroid medication. She got that adjusted and has been a less anxious in the intervening time. But this is sort of a I can pick out a signal it's not clear if there is any meaning to the signal like there are so many things going on in our lives and that's not necessarily it's not even clear. There's a correlation if there were it would not be sufficient evidence for any more causative role, but it seems to me like one has a mood regulating gland keeping the dosage of replacement hormone for that glass table is probably a good idea when one already has difficulty regulating mood so\n",
            "Patient: This is one of the things where we talked about some we talked some about my difficulty difficulty with what is she responsible for and what is she not? This is the thing that I feel like she is a very responsible for and that is like perfectly under control you go to the doctor you get things checked you take the medication until you just take maybe think about it a little bit and assess whether you're doing reasonable things with your treatment in that regard and make sure that he stays stable. That's it. And that's the thing that she's done fantastically poorly at and just continue to do poorly at in some sense. Like I don't know whether she does not understand that after 3 days. She only has only 70% or less of the thyroid hormone in her system or what?\n",
            "Doctor: Did you ask her?\n",
            "Patient: No, because she already feels guilty about not having gotten the medication and so like I intend to ask her but the problem with exponential decay is like impulse treatment. It's easy to drop off very quickly after a week. She would have half or less of the hormone and her sister but it takes a long time to build back up. And so if this is actually contributing factor talking about it particular when I'm kind of angry about the fact that she has failed to do this simple thing again, because we've talked about getting her thyroid medication before we talked about how I went and got her thyroid medication like three months ago because she didn't have it is not seem like a good idea at the time so seem like not an important issue to confront in this specific moment because she was already going to get it and that day\n",
            "Doctor: So that was Monday so you didn't find out that she wasn't taking it.\n",
            "Patient: Until she I found out she wasn't getting any so it wasn't I did not need to do anything to get her to get it. It was just a why on Earth have you not been doing this? And I don't understand how one feels to do errands like sometimes you get busy. Sometimes you don't feel like doing whatever particular are and I get that but this is not an errand of the same magnitude as getting butter or something.\n",
            "Doctor: That is if you really need butter. That policy.\n",
            "Patient: Fair enough. There's also something which I don't like. Yes. This is the thing. She's failed to do several times. She doesn't remember all the other times. She's failed to do they at least nine. Sorry, I wasn't Yes is the things she's failed to do several times. She doesn't remember all other times. She's failed to do it. At least not in the last several months. So like me being upset about this as part of a trend is not useful or perhaps not even a fair thing. It's certainly not a thing that I think it's worth bringing to the discussion to have in an emotional sense enough actual sense. It is important to know that is the recurring problem, and maybe we need a different solution then wait until you have run out and get a few days later. Bye.\n",
            "Doctor: There are a couple questions that I have one is what are you worried about in sort of staying in the moment when you're not feeling upset about something like this.\n",
            "Patient: I mean we talked since when Tony was here that she has a hard time handling me being upset. And so like I am concerned that me being angry is going to impact or negatively but in a dangerous way.\n",
            "Doctor: Is the dangerous part the important part?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I don't know. It's sort of makes sense. It sort of makes it easier to justify like behaving in this fashion. I'm not sure that that's actually that I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I think this is the heart of the matter in your marriage is how free are you? How free are you maybe that's the end of the sentence and how much are you as you describe very pointedly held hostage. You certainly feel more free than you did maybe two months ago, but clearly not fully free because you don't feel you can express yourself when you feel angry because you're very worried about the implications in a very dire way.\n",
            "Patient: And I'm not always as worried about the implications and a diary way as it was this time. I thought she was doing particularly poorly. But I like this is back into it. If my guess is about the thyroid issues is correct and she is in the more unstable place in the specific moment. And so it's like so yes, the concerns are more dire. Then I guess I feel like you made a statement and I mostly agree with the statement and so I'm not sure what to say in response. Yeah. I think that's an accurate assessment. It does not feel particularly free to say that I found this upsetting not that I can completely hide from her when I find something upsetting but\n",
            "Doctor: So are you saying nowhere to go? It's like you don't have a train of any thoughts or you don't know what to do about it or\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I don't know what to do about it. Now I feel like you're pointing to this thing I'm saying. Yes. That seems like about the right thing.\n",
            "Doctor: now what?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: you know we can spend time talking about that more but I'm not sure what further description of the problem will do if we both already grasped what the problem is, or maybe the point is I don't fully grasp what the problem is, but\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's the part. I'm not sure that you specifically don't fully grasp. Maybe we don't know all of what's at stake. I mean, you're not the one to do something because you're feeling that is going to set you already fragile way around suicide alley over the edge that construction. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's logical that makes sense. But then there are also some students and that that sort of things need to be thought about\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and this is a big case. It wasn't so much like It wasn't so much that I thought that she was suicidal in the moment. And that anything I said my push over the edge, but it certainly has a subjects related to my behavior in this time. So it's more than so part of it is that since she's already made that or is about to make the call. To get the prescription refill There's no practical value in asking. Why did you do this? Because she's already fixed it and some cents or as much as it is possible to fix it at that point. And so there is no immediacy to the discussion even to happen in about time. She already feels guilty. I'm bad about not having done it and I feel angry and that's only use what kind of combination of emotions for us to have the conversation. And so if I were to wait for a little while before bringing it up again, I can be less angry and she can be less guilty and maybe we can actually have a conversation in which the in which the likes box or piece that she has to do with it in a more timely fashion can be discussed.\n",
            "Doctor: I was thinking that there are a couple pieces in that one is that it's helpful to know why I'm not just commenting on the timeline of when you bring it up, but she really may have not think it impacts her mood of the way you feel a Mite and so that's a conversation.\n",
            "Patient: It's also conversation. She really doesn't like having she really doesn't like it when I suggest that this I have watched this thing impact your mood.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know why she doesn't like it?\n",
            "Patient: That's a good question. I think it's just a piece where she feels like someone else can notice it, but she should have noticed. I think there's a piece where she has had plenty of people tell her. Oh, you should try this secure your depression. You know, like when I had a headache I took some Aspirin you had a migraine you should take some aspirin also and that's with an LG and it doesn't she has a particular I read about that class of discussion and I think any suggestion of this is a thing that is contributing to your mood to have some emotion.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it this pedantic?\n",
            "Patient: I think so. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: All these things seem like great openings conversations. Like if she does feel like you're being pedantic maybe there's information in that you're being pedantic taking that you are. I'm not you are in response to something in this Behavior. She's doing this actually listening that responds. So it's an enter fraction. You're not just an acting in a vacuum. That's an interesting kind of conversation. I mean, there is a lot of interesting you're saying these are the reasons not to have a conversation and I'm saying those are actually interesting departures for a conversation.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that was I was attending to give reasons not to have that conversation in the moment when I'm angry and she has like in that moment. Your first qualifying statement was not commenting on the time scale. These are reasons to have that conversation and that sounds right. and I guess now we're at the point of needing to talk about the time scale because I think Yeah, I think you're right that those are interesting departure points for conversations. There are stations back. We haven't been able to have the way we would have two or three years ago and more recent. My day is like in the last 4 months, but that's because there has been a sense in which the Tonya I would have those conversations with hasn't existed in the last several months. There's a sense in which she really is there again, so yeah, those are the conversations that Would be good to have as conversations and not just me telling her that she needs to take the medicine medication.\n",
            "Doctor: What were you just thinking?\n",
            "Patient: Just very vaguely about the strange place. Our lives are in terms of like how do we get to the place where I'm telling her to take her medication like house? Like how is that like how what would seem like a reasonable motive interaction for us? It's just not. Yeah, it's just not really that's not really a partnership or relationship so much as it I don't know. How do I say? I'm not sure what the word to use but guardianship\n",
            "Doctor: stewardship\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I don't know. I think that's the thing to grow to regain and I really I think that doing that in a normative hiring motion is a way to work toward regaining the mode of interaction.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I thought on that obviously whatever you want to do you do the issue at hand is that you felt for so long that you had to bracket your needs for the sake of Tonya and innocence about a conflict that your needs if they don't maybe not to say undermine her needs. At least undermine your ability to be present for her. So there's a conflict on that level. This is may be more direct that maybe you need to be expressive at the moment actually undermines what you think her need is to stay alive. Her need is whether it undermines it or not. If the question it goes to the heart of I mean, you may not think that it's much to give up by waiting a day or so. It may not that may not be a big issue for you, but it sort of guessed the heart of how much do you need to bracket your needs or hold yourself back and strain yourself or confine yourself for the sake of poignant. What were you thinking?\n",
            "Patient: I hate thinking I can't you say that's right. What do I talk about in response to that? And I think the important thing is that I think that it's impacting the way I interact with people and more generally particularly for I think that in a sense habit of rocking my needs is in order to maintain it. I have done it more than just in my relationship with Tanya and it's hard to notice it at first and some sense because I usually try to be a considerate person taking into account the needs of other people. So this and a sense, please directly into a worldview that I have already have and so it's I think it's hard to notice or has been hard to notice that\n",
            "Doctor: And it's a fine line. It's on a Continuum. They're not discrete categories being considerate of others needs sometimes means bracketing your needs of it.\n",
            "Patient: Sure.\n",
            "Doctor: Then sort of extrapolate out, you know in and being especially considered of being desperate.\n",
            "Patient: rain\n",
            "Doctor: You know, there's no there is not distinct category. That's a Continuum which makes it more complicated. It's like on one level you're not wanting to express yourself In the Heat of the Moment for fear of hurting Tanya. It also sounds reasonable enough, but there is more complexity to it than that cuz that always have to be the cage.\n",
            "Patient: If it does have to be the case right now or how long does it have to be the case because I don't know that it's really sustainable thing for years. I'm not even sure that's really a relationship again.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm clear that when we've talked about this before I put in a very direct manner Tanya Tennessee to abdicate her responsibility and your tendency to fill in all of the spaces a responsibility whether it's your responsibility or not, even your entitlement or not to do so does not fit well. I mean in some ways it fits very well, but in others.\n",
            "Patient: It works perfectly perfectly together.\n",
            "Doctor: Where is perfectly accepted doesn't help either of you?\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: And so when you say how is it that we've gotten to this point that I'm telling her to take her medication.\n",
            "Patient: Well, yeah, that's a pretty good mechanistic answer for how we got there. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: When you're speaking to Tanya as you might kind of might tell A demented grandmother, did you take your medication today? I'm not saying you said it in that boy's butt that becomes a structure.\n",
            "Patient: Ryan so I try not to do that to avoid that structure but end up in this place and then I'm angry and we're back into it. Like it's a complicated in that way.\n",
            "Doctor: But you broadened it when you started to think about as the extent to which you do that and this in a very particular context in your marriage and also in terms of what's going on for Tanya, but then you're sort of expanding into thinking about how this plays out in other relationships for you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so we were visiting our friends last week and you know, occasionally like the question of what you want to do and I found it nearly impossible to answer that question. I always find that something of a difficult question because I feel like my needs needs to be balanced against some sense of group needs which I think comes from having for siblings and having a strong recognition that we all have desires like from an early age. But usually I find the problem like, where's the balance of something like that here? I found unable to identify a particular or desire. Sometimes it's also the case like sometimes I just don't care but But in this context it seemed or scenes or something. Like I have suppressed that desires to the extent that I can't find them.\n",
            "Doctor: Where do you think they went?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I don't know. It's one of my thinking about this problem of what to do. I want to do next. What is the next step in my career. Really? I have a hard time figuring out what I want, but I do have some desire still like there is a sense in which I really don't want to live in a city larger than this. I'd rather live in a city smaller than this. I can be sort of very clear that I don't want that but it's taking me a little bit of time to recognize that desire or anti desire.\n",
            "Doctor: Denver is a pretty big city. There are that many cities in the country bigger than this.\n",
            "Patient: That's true.\n",
            "Doctor: In general if you count the Metro.\n",
            "Patient: Sure.\n",
            "Doctor: So that's actually not hard. I'm sure there are more concentration of jobs in those larger cities.\n",
            "Patient: There is that problem. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But still there are not that many cities that are larger.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's not a problem. Like the issue is something more like it took me awhile to come to recognize that this is something that I don't want. Although it's really obvious that I don't want that. I'm not that happy living in the city like in a day today since it's just really noisy. And there's nowhere Greener quiet. I read There are trees. So at least there are trees on the street. It's not like parts of Delaware. But yeah, so I don't know where they went, but I can recognize them as they come back or something.\n",
            "Doctor: Comeback meaning that they were there, but they are buried.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't think I I don't think that I cease to have desires. I think I cease to know what they were but I could be wrong about that. Maybe I just stopped having any desires that I'm not sure at some point. I don't know that it matters like a particular sense that I can't find them so they might as well not exist.\n",
            "Doctor: Pretend like a big difference that they're there, but they're buried versus if they were never there because someone sends you then have to create something and other since you have to find out where they might be.\n",
            "Patient: And those processes feel similar to me, but they may not be.\n",
            "Doctor: This is sort of a strange matter for but it's sort of like the difference between giving a piece of paper and a pen or you going to shovel like a paper and pen is creating something that isn't there and a shovel is going to dig around to see where they went.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: to me, they seem like different processes, but\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. Maybe that doesn't feel right. Maybe they\n",
            "Patient: You know, I do a lot of research and so the process of search and the process of research are pretty similar as far as idea the process of coming up with something new in the process of figuring out what is already known. They have some more me some essential similarity. They may not be as similar as I think they are because other people certainly seem to find them very very discreet enquiries. It's interesting for me is like here are the values of what we know. Obviously the next thing to look for is this but if you take away one of those pieces presumably it's the next obvious Beast look for in the cell. Thinking about the shovel the pain that's a good for its contrast and I'd much rather. Tell which is that never existed in which of them existed and cease to be and which are just hidden.\n",
            "Doctor: No not know. We're going to stop today. See you next week.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Take care of but why?\n",
            "Patient: YouTube\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: How are you?\n",
            "Patient: I'm okay. I think I don't know. I'm kind of not sure I feel okay today. I don't know. I think I'm definitely kind of mildly depressed or something. I feel tired. I was just a crazy. I was already feeling a little bit off before all of this shit happens. So\n",
            "Doctor: What was it like for your Friday?\n",
            "Patient: it was crazy was definitely traumatizing. There's no question.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh my goodness. This was a night you mean?\n",
            "Patient: Thursday after they killed that cop and got chased into Chest Tire. I don't know it's going to take some time. And then what was it 20 hours? I don't know. It's hard to put into words that kind of hair because at that point your life. Well, this guy has nothing obviously he knows it's over they didn't care about dying or killing other people. So it would just make sense if I was that person and and that insane then it would only make sense to just knock my Someone's door take a few more people out and just blow yourself up. There are no words to explain it to feel like that could happen. I mean, yeah, there were armed. But all that takes is a second if he knows he's going to die. Anyway, just do it. It was a fucking it was just you know, I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: the starting point of hearing the noises and then seeing them I would think that alone is\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, I just like the sounds were so loud. It was clearly there was no confusing. I mean it was surreal. It was surreal. Suddenly. It sounded like there was a war going on. The horrifying part the first thing I thought because it sounded like it was so much noise. It didn't sound like two or three people. I was horrified that they come to Josiah and there was some kind of group. Do you know what I mean? And that there was suddenly 30 insane people waiting fully armed for me. I don't know what that was horrifying horrifying.\n",
            "Doctor: Because you don't know what's happening at that Quinn at all.\n",
            "Patient: No idea no idea.\n",
            "Doctor: How many are there had you been asleep?\n",
            "Patient: No, I was wide awake. I had just walk down that way. Night. It was a nice night since I already wasn't feeling that great that week. I was like, you know, I'm just going to take a walk. I walked right where all went down like around 11 and then I got home and I was talking to my friend in Phoenix. So we were talking I had the window kind of open and I saw all these cops flying down the street and I thought that's weird. The cops were going really fast. I was like, yeah, this is not normal then by the time I told grgo Giorgio I heard two loud noises and then I hung up.\n",
            "Doctor: You went down to get your mom.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I grabbed Cecilia. I grabbed my shoes. My mom was already awake. I was like we're going right now. We're getting in the car and we're going but then for whatever reason I thought to call 911 when I told them my address and stuff and they were like just turn off all the lights and don't go near the windows. Definitely do not leave your house lock all the doors. It was crazy on the other hand once it was over. I also felt a tremendous. Amount of I mean, I've never been prouder to be from Chester between the corporation of citizens and law enforcement. That's fucking amazing. We're going to get the 911 guys just fucking Han hunted them down like dogs. It's kind of weird. I don't know when I think it felt like a police state. It was a police state that was kind of weird. I don't know how you get around that if this is the world we're going to live in You're going to have to give up some civil liberties. So when it was all over it did feel good. I went out with people thinking cops and that felt pretty amazing. They were doing all these sweeps. They came over to her house several times one of the times on Friday before they get called this guy. The police on the Block knocked on the door and went down and it was casually very moving because when I open the door suddenly, they became very human. They were like, hey, we're just doing a door-to-door. We want to see how everyone is doing. Are you guys doing? Okay? That was very moving actually, but then it's depressing because I know this is going to happen again. I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often. It's just very depressing. It's a big country and there a lot of people just random just freaks over all I guess. I'm okay. I just feel tired. I definitely kind of I definitely feel kind of depressed. I don't feel very motivated. I've been feeling a little bit sick to my stomach. I was telling my mom everything would be okay, but in my mind I was like well, what are the chances of him coming in the house?\n",
            "Doctor: They cut up.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but then I was like what are the chances of anything of any of this is happening. It is happening in my backyard and all of our backyards and that neighborhood so or anyone Love isn't very well Cloud could it's not like we don't know where they're all apps, but when it's like what are the chances they're going to end up at my house, but one little lie, there's a major event klusterfuk clearly. It could happen. It's here.\n",
            "Doctor: He's going to end up in somebody's yard or house.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: It's very very scary. I thought of you even with the police knocking on people's doors. I mean, I know they're there for a good reason and they're there to help and protect but just police alone have been have been a form of trauma.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah this time with that. I don't feel that this time. I felt good that they were around but I just can't put it into words. It was surreal. It was beyond or suddenly there would be a commotion at one of the houses around us where they be surrounding the house yelling to my peoples come out bizarre. I don't know why those houses usually the people that would come to our some white old ladies that just drives home that he could be hiding anywhere here.\n",
            "Doctor: Even that though, it's not just that he could come to your house you're watching this happened. He could be right there.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right and really where he ended up is.\n",
            "Doctor: Not far, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. It's weird that only accentuated how was already feeling so now Everything feels really weird and discombobulated. It's just strange going back to our routines. I guess all in all I'm doing okay, but yesterday I was like, wow, do I need to see doctor Carlton again? Maybe do I have some kind of low-grade depression going on even before all this happen? I wasn't feeling awful, but I just I'm just so tired.\n",
            "Doctor: Before all this happened you would been in a space for a week or a week and a half where it was like coming down off of slow of tremendous energy about the two sites connecting you've been pushing and pushing and working and actually been productive and staying up late you had your hand and so many things moving for how could you keep that pace forever impossible? You got sick a little bit you got tired just letting your body be compressed. And then as you are decompression, you're aware that there's just a lot of other stuff their feelings about relationships were talking about Kelly and Bethany going back and forth and just feeling really confused. I think about what you're feeling and what happens the closer you get to somebody and makes you makes you then sort of look elsewhere. You think a lot of confusion as new things we're getting open. Apps for the first time and then this happens I could see in the state but this just added fuel to the fire being totally turned upside down and inside out for a while.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's funny because last night Kelly came over and we just hung out at home. It was really nice, but I don't know what it is. I just it's like there's a part of me that just wants to reach tree and just wants to be alone. I just don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe a metaphor about being let out of prison and again The Coincidence of this event happening right now as you're really getting into this process. I think more opening talk about what happens when you you're really known to another person whether it's me, whether it's Kelly as a relationship grows deeper and you're actually being your whole self and not just editing and picking and choosing what to say and who to be she's being her whole self. But this event in a way it is filling you with a massive amount of hair again, that's something else in a way, but that's what's there's working right now. This is going to be terrifying I will get hurt if I get close to her the way I think you have been in the past in your childhood.\n",
            "Patient: Or will I hurt her?\n",
            "Doctor: Will you hurt her right? Are you the terrorists are you going to get terrified?\n",
            "Patient: Because right now there's something in me that feels a little bit Reckless like flirting with other girls. There's something in me. That's whatever.\n",
            "Doctor: There's so much of your life because of your relationship with your mother. That is given you those two options either you get hurt or you hurt someone else and if that's the choice hurting someone else is in some way preferable to getting hurt but it's like there's nothing else in the middle of those two.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know. I just feel drained. My appetite is back, but I just feel off.\n",
            "Doctor: I also get the feeling that there's a lot of feeling, you know, you say sometimes you hit these moments where you're watching something and there's a feeling comes out like a release amount and then you feel better. It has that feeling to me that there's something jammed up inside.\n",
            "Patient: probably\n",
            "Doctor: Even just from what you went through Friday.\n",
            "Patient: Well, I did have one of those moments Friday when they came and they said how are you doing when I lock the door. That was the one time I just completely broke down.\n",

            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, you know it was good or I think there was another time when I was petting Cecilia or something.\n",
            "Doctor: 12 * it's feeling kind of being cared for.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah throughout this whole thing. I did have moments like that where I cried there will always be more good people. I'm so proud to be from here. I don't know any of I don't know of any hate crimes so far or just in general people opening their homes or giving people rides or whatever. It might be. It's amazing. Even the law enforcement as much as I don't like cops in this case. God bless them. Unbelievable. I think the problem though is this just highlights and build up the exit essential stuff that I feel it's just all absurd and random things happen. It's overwhelming.\n",
            "Doctor: And yet you also feel something when you're thinking about the good outweighing the bad.\n",

            "Patient: And then today is the commemoration of the Assyrian genocide. That's so funny. You normally to me, it's likely my it's like my dad. I just think about it. And anyway, you don't need one day to come right commemorate millions of people but there is something ironic about happening in chest higher. It's weird.\n",
            "Doctor: Friday to bring up your father.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, it brought up lots of things, you know in a way. It just shows that life is sure. It's more like trying to beat the clock the shit that I'm juggling and trying to get done. It's just\n",
            "Doctor: Workwise it makes sense in relationship. I think it feels more confusing. What kind of threat lost conflict.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah and relationships. I don't know. I don't know what to make of it Kelly and I hung out Sunday. We went to Mystic when I'm with her. It's great. But also, I don't know what to make of some of my superficial feelings. Like I wish you were skinny. She's very pretty but I don't know there's that I'm a little confused. I'm just confused. It definitely feels like a rollercoaster. Now, you know what, I mean, like earlier today. I was feeling good and now I feel like shit.\n",
            "Doctor: And then what happened?\n",

            "Doctor: It isn't even an appearance thing. It just feels like there's just a weight of the world on your shoulders right now with this whatever. This is is stirring around your father like the whole family history of genocide and Trauma and torture. There's a lot in this Brian. It's hard enough just to be trying to remember in here in this process and kind of your pace getting yourself through a real thing actually just happened in a real-time and this is like other things. It's not all nevermind you and brings you back to feelings of these other experiences, but other another one you're experiencing right now, like all the feelings after your father's death that led you to cut yourself off and being meter lost in the world. To the world out to Oregon just aimless and Associated I can imagine that hopefully on a smaller scale and hopefully caught that kind of what we're here to do and help you but I can imagine that being a piece of what's happening right now. You have enough work under your belt and that there's this other life that you have going on that feels like it's yours in your attending to it. But how could this not be triggering for you for of some of the pretty dramatic feelings about to mention where you were right before this happened in the process?\n",
            "Patient: and the funny thing is that I knew that the not that was happening even before like when the bombings happen. I knew that something triggered. It's just like what the fuc the only two things I keep telling myself is that one? It's not just me. It happened in a whole neighborhood and number two. People died in those families people are named. and a number to at least I have this one to come to also this is an opportunity to instead of becoming so disassociated. That's where work can ground you. I just have to find a way to regain some energy right now. That's what it is. I just feel like I have no energy. I just feel kind of sick.\n",
            "Doctor: I think what I say, of course in no wonder as part of just trying to say the part of you thinking that really gets anxious about where you are today. And what would be weird if you were there today given your history.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You can go back to Doctor Carlton. I don't think this is something that we should medicate. This is what you would do. If something like this happened, it's starting to happen after Monday and you come out of this probably actually sooner than you think.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, right right. I've been in mining myself of that too. That's where I was trying. That's what I was saying. I'm actually handling it better than\n",

Good bad good bad not just interested in your experience. I think that's why so often you moved to wanting to judge yourself. Like this is bad that this is happening to me and then you say but the good thing is that I'm doing this. It's like things have to be judged as good or bad and there's something kind of comforting and familiar familiar and knowing whether it gets to go on it in the good column or if it gets to go in the bad, I just think that what's your family did but it's not about knowing who you are. It's not about knowing it's about categorizing and black and white kind of thinking. What are you thinking?\n",

            "Patient: I don't know. I was thinking on the one hand what sucks now is I'm full of anxiety. But what is the next thing that's going to happen? Like what's the next bad thing that's going to happen. Today I was like I could try to write about this but then of course I was thinking yeah. Well, that's what I say about a lot of things and then I don't actually do anything.\n",

            "Patient: Yeah, I know. Not really. It's a curse to be so ambitious and must be nice to just not be as much I have all these things on my plate. No one put them there. I am paying them there, but I can't help it.\n",
            "Doctor: I think waiting for the next bad thing to happen is trauma. This is a symptom of being traumatized. There's this hyper Village Inns is it happens many different for it takes many different forms expectation that something really bad is going to happen and just waiting for its in some way adopted way of being if you're used to really bad things and keep happening to you if you're at least prepared for them and that's what it's meant for in any way. But again, why would you not be waiting for that right now and why also for example would not freeze you up from reading a regular underarm life and That's also what happen when you were twenty if horrible horrible things happen your whole system starts to responding as if you were there for survival and waiting for the next blow. It's not about that. It's not about then forward-thinking and productivity and planning and being a proactive person reactivity. It's what's important when you're in trauma for safety, I could see also this feeling as you look down on yourself that you're not Doing it. That's what happens when your brain is preoccupied with staying safe and your brain became very pretty occupied with staying safe as you became really Psycho-Pass Matic after your father's death all of the fears about not me.

It's like there's there's a bad thing coming from the relationship. There's a dagger that you could be waiting for with Kelly or else we waiting to go out to Talia. That's feels better. And I'm here.

I was like, well, when are you going to get adderal in? This is Friday, I guess maybe Saturday. I don't know. And they said Tuesday because the pharmacist had to order it yesterday and then it would come in today after 8 p.m. I'm like, well, I'm not going to take it until Monday anyway, so what's an extra day so I haven't started it yet.\n",

            "Patient: Like coming home and putting my wallet and my keys in the same spot every time so I don't lose them things like that.

            "Doctor: Yeah, I know the diagnostic criteria. I'm a little skeptical of some of the source of questionnaires for this kind of thing. But whatever the bottom line is you try the medication and if it helps, that's great if it doesn't help then stop.\n",
            "Patient: Well, I told Jess and she was like well I suspected it.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess the main reason I wonder about it is difficulties with the intention and even organization can we relate to depression and anxiety as well? You know if somebody is depressed they have a lot more trouble focusing often times and so with paying attention and following through they tend to be a little less organized and just generally Less on top of things you can be difficult to differentiate which is which I guess the primary way of doing that would be there are a few ways to think about it. When would be through your history if you have ADD than the extent to which you have trouble focusing and trouble being organized should be fairly consistent through your history. Whereas if it's due more to depression than those sort of difficulty should increase or decrease along with the extent of your depression or anxiety. Do you know what I mean?\n",

And then you know, the creation of a written report that is usually between 6 and 15 pages long or so and that's kind of the gold standard for this kind of diagnosis. But you know, you may have it and the questionnaires are a good in terms of day can be helpful and better than nothing. Like I said, the treatment implications are pretty straightforward and that's not a big hoss in any way associated with them. So you may as well try it.\n",

It's good to work with somebody who is more specialized the most specialized people are neuropsychologist II must specialized people are usually mental health conditions that work with kids. The third most specialized are pediatricians. Not that they're bad. It's just that pediatricians do 900 different things, you know, if you which are mental health, I guess that's what I'm saying. right\n",

If every six-year-old boy whose coming was a mess who lost us who didn't follow their parents directions who don't follow through what things was diagnosed with ADHD there would be probably three 6 year old boys and two of them who were asleep who did not meet the criteria for ADHD. Perhaps I'm skeptical I have worked with kids many kids who had other conditions that were misdiagnosed often by pediatricians with ADHD.\n",

It dawned on me that is missing link that they didn't put it in the title reference, but it had to have been through probate. It's like 2:30 in the Probate Court closes at 4:30. I had Siri look up on my way flying down. I pull up the index and sure enough the guy who had the property died with a will and all I need to confirm is this one person was the sole heir of the will or the person in the will to get the property but it's in storage. The file is in storage is starting to put everything in storage now which fucks me because these are typically the late sixties and seventies are when I need probate and older ones. They order on Fridays, but they're not going to order it until Friday and I'm not going to have it until Tuesday.\n",

So for some reason I decided to go get Chinese food whenever I get Chinese food I get way too much and I hate it all. I basically just fell asleep on the couch and never got out and finish the title even waking up at 11 and was up for several hours. I just blew it off. And I'm not really even anxious or stressed out about it. Really what was interesting is that Sunday morning was one of those days I get anxious about I had to take Ian to snowboarding.\n",

So it probably would have been fine. Actually the first thing that kind of came and at first I was like fuck but then I was like it is what it is. And you know, if I'm a few minutes late then I'm a few minutes late. I get out to the slopes and Jess's mom agrees because they live right there.\n",

So I put $99 so we'll see if someone buys it today tomorrow is the last day, but I knew that was going to be my problem selling the ticket when people want to watch the game.\n",

I don't know if I'm allowed to run alongside him as he's going up this thing to pick him up when he falls because they'll shut the tow rope off.\n",

You see a helmet you a kit. Instructor accidentally bumped into his head when he was sitting down and I could tell he kind of wind a little bit about that. I don't know if his helmet doesn't fit him or he's just sensitive, you know, so to make him stop crying. I told him to hit me in the head. He's not very strong. It's like harder harder harder.

I don't know. I probably just like having someone there. I don't know. Baby, do these things? I don't know and also just needs the support of yeah. And I would like for him to move out of Miami, but he needs has to stay there until April 1st because you got a DUI over a year ago and he has to finish up his this contract thing. I guess you leave April 1st or something. But until then it's he has to stay there. I don't know.\n",

I don't know so worried about something that doesn't not able to directly I don't know deal with it or I don't know so I go back and forth between I don't know if trying to trying not to think about it, and I don't know being worried, but we'll see. I guess if you have any other suggestions, I'll just go across. I don't know counseling.\n",

What I would do would be tried calling Psychiatry tree Department. I want a more hospital possibly even a New York see if you can get ahold of the psych ER and ask if there are any good Community clinics are other low-cost mental health clinic those will sometimes you're by so I can still work for your treatment to people who didn't have much right here. I'm not sure how it is. Now. There are clients. I know in Brighton in Manchester Community Clinic or even if some of the hospitals like probably MGH at Manchester Hospital mental, you can pretty much just walking. I mean, I don't necessarily mean walk in and get an immediate treatment for walk in and get treatment sometimes pretty good treatment for my Chinese which is what he'd be getting I guess where you but as you say. And hopefully well supervised and sometimes the people supervising a running that's going to really very good and sometimes not but I'm guessing that expands Oral Roberts you thought with it along somewhere I want but yeah if you called out Best Buy, Christiana Hospital in the area they could probably just tell you that was offered there as well as what else you could go to because I probably referral they have to make a robot.\n",

I don't understand that freeze out or whatever. He was doing. I don't know. I don't know. He's just playing them for his situation, but I'm not quite sure. Whenever I asked him, I don't really remember or because it must just not make sense to me. I don't know so my mom's worried and all these other things and she asked about him all the time and I'm just like well, why don't you I'm always like be proactive with just seems to never never tell you these things and I don't know flop over and she's like, I just want him to come home and I'm like, well, that's not an option. I don't think that's good for him. I don't know. I don't know. What is this lack of looking into things do things? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know but it's\n",

She always twisted or I don't know or makes it worse or either makes me feel guilty or something. I don't know. I just don't want to deal with it. I don't want to but I I don't know. I don't know.

I wish you would I mean I know she can't or I don't know but I wish someone was like, okay, look, here it is. This is what we're doing do it. I don't know. She's just doesn't want that or any responsibility to deal with this and I know she can't because she can't talk to Stephen, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't know but\n",

Anyway, in a way that feels like you got bootstrap or you got to figure out how you're going to handle something even when it would be pretty easy just to shut down or look away from it, and she doesn't seem to do that.

She's just like doesn't want any part or doesn't know how to deal with it. I don't know. It's just such a difference. I don't know and I don't like I hate talking to strangers.

It was one of the last ones called and his friend Harris is older as well in his forties. I don't know. And in talking to them they seemed I don't know Proactiv we can do this little and then I don't know people like Marlow and Vicky are very anything that were looking up stuff for going down with me or giving me option.

Yeah, and it also would add some structure to your day. You make sure you're around people you can help you get hooked up with outpatient readers for awkward stuff like that or I'm going groups know when somebody's pretty stack or they're really having a hard time or have the people around them really quite worried which it sounds like he does. It could be our way. He could really reach once again, where is if he starts with a new outpatient therapist. He's going to probably once or twice a week.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: It takes a while to get to know them.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",

            "Doctor: Then yeah, I think you're crying you to transfer that kind of a day program or an outpatient program. But once he's got insurance, you could probably start one and you were somebody else could call up a hospital or hospitals near him the offer that\n",

They don't give you a warning and some places to come around with a loudspeaker. That means I had to move my car at 8. I should have gone to the sea to the CVS to pick up medicine. So my meds are so screwed up right now.\n",

I got this one kind of litigation case that's supposed to go on trial in January, which it looks like it looks likely but it's not I've got to tell the guy that's flying in from Europe that it's not going to happen. I'm putting a bad position because she wants to move the trial but she's supposed to propose the first draft of the pre-trial memorandum. Then I fill in my information and we go back and forth and Hammer out the memorandum for the judge. She's got to put in there all her Witnesses the facts on which she's relying her damages stuff. I don't have from her yet.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: The order for this thing came out months ago. And now she's claiming as requested on multiple occasions. I requested it yesterday and she's telling me that the clerk told her she doesn't need to do one what judge is going to go on trial without a memo. There may not be a conference, but you still need to do the memo. How do I get how do I go into court and say no don't continue this trial but by the way, I'm unprepared for trial because she won't do the memo. I'm in a catch-22. My guy is screwed because there's nothing I can do for him. We can't go to trial in January because I'm completely unprepared. I have no clue even what damages they're asking for because I don't have this memo in my mind. I've got certain strategic emotions. I'm going to play at the beginning of the trial which include Witnesses and testimony and all the stuff until she lays all that out what she has to do. This isn't like on TV where they all of a sudden come up with ever with everything is supposed to be out in the open. There are no surprises. I just trying to litigate by ambush. My client is caught in the middle of it and I'm caught in the middle of it and I don't really know what to do. What I what am I supposed to do ask for his plane ticket money as sanction, which they're not going to give me I'm losing a battle of their unwillingness unwillingness to litigate this case and I can't force them to the only thing I can think of is to do is ask them to dismiss the trial they send them not doing this memorandum.\n",
            "Doctor: The thing I don't get is that you're saying that she's screwing up and sort of not playing by the rules. She supposed to play by and get some how that's going to help her win because\n",
            "Patient: Well, it wins the battle not the war because there are sufficient remedies for this to offset her type of litigation. This is why Jesse hates divorce because they all litigate like this she stands there in open court and so she can do a trial on January 14th, and then all of a sudden she has another matter marked up and she's claiming the court never sent out a notice of the trial but she stood there and core in front of the judge and told the judge to his face. Yes. I can do a trial on that day. That's not going to be good enough. They're going to change the date because she's got something else. I'm in the position that I can't say judge. No, let's have the trial. We can't have the trial because I'm completely unprepared. Why am I am prepared because of her?\n",
            "Doctor: Right, so there's no consequences for her not being ready.\n",
            "Patient: That's why I'm going to try to ask her for her cause of action to be dismissed because she's not Prosecuting it the order has been out there. I've made multiple requests. She stands in open court and takes a trial date and then can't meet the trial date because she's got some other matter that she's now scheduled the judge said we need to get them the memo by December 1st, and she just plays dumb now she claims in an email that the clerk told her. She doesn't need to do a pre-trial memo. I think the clerk may have said there's no pre-trial conference, but I refuse to go to trial without a pre-trial memo. That's totally ambitious me, you know. Now I've got to go in and first of all, she's got to serve this motion. I may just go ahead and file my motion to dismiss. I've got to figure out what basis if there's any case law or anyting I'm thinking the way to beat this woman is to just start dragging her into court and on stuff make her life difficult, even if it it makes mine. I've got to know email my clients and tell them once again, we've been duped not duped but things are out of our control you switching and coming home for Thanksgiving instead of that and coming home for a trial in January. That's now not going to happen. At least you get to see your family. I could say just fire me that would make it easy.\n",
            "Doctor: Then you feel pretty helpless actually in like you can be beat this way and there's not much you can do about it. There's not a that's not exactly what you're saying, but it sounds like that's feels like\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, totally. I'm anxious about it, but it's just happened. So many times. I don't know why I get anxious about the real estate stuff, but and I'm not as anxious as I would be about this stuff. I guess I've been anxious over it for so long that I finally just gotten used to it. I don't know. I've just got anxiety about the helplessness I guess but it's not like concern I'd have about getting these payoffs and all these little things involved in closings. I don't know. It just doesn't make sense to me that this other stuff gets me so worked up by the way. Did you get my text?\n",
            "Doctor: Know what did it say? When did you send it?\n",
            "Patient: Yesterday, I was just following up on the IRS letter.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, yes. Yes. I got it and it went over my head but I thought about it and I thought I haven't done anything on it. Tell me again what you need and I will do by Friday. How's that?\n",
            "Patient: That's good, I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: By when do you need it?\n",
            "Patient: My lawyer said the 13th, but I think as long as we're getting them stuff. Some of it can be a little delayed. So Friday would be fine.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you sure?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: All right. I'll get it in by Friday or in the next couple of days.\n",
            "Patient: When is the 13th what's today the 11th?\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, so that's Thursday.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, Friday would be fine. You can't say that. I'm in the same. Obviously. I'm not as bad as the last letter that obviously had me in a really bad state.\n",
            "Doctor: weather update, okay\n",
            "Patient: I would focus on how I still have difficulties with work in Newark. Whatever. Sounds good.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think it will be hard for me to update it a little bit and soften some of what about is how hard a time you're having but still say you're not out of the woods essentially you're a better functioning and more able to work with suicide by the depression in a way that keeps you from. I don't know not. Schening something to that effect. Okay. Sorry about that.\n",
            "Patient: It's okay. First of all, they wanted the business statements updated. And of course, I've made all this money in the last month or so, but I already spent it that one out the door as soon as that came in. I could see the money go in and I could see the money fly out. The thing is my bank statements don't have the checks copies of the checks or the actual.\n",
            "Doctor: ritecheck Sia posited\n",
            "Patient: Right, so they don't know who the payee is our Iran a payee report. I think they're probably going to raise our monthly amount, but they're going to cut it back from a 60-month to a 24 month which is a huge chunk of money.\n",
            "Doctor: will work out overall when you pay her because they're shortening it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they're shortening it no matter what I think they've already committed to shortening it but we proposed to 60 months plan. So, I don't know we're really just not pulling in a lot of money. At least that's what it was. Looks like it's the truth. I can't use my heat. It's a good thing. It's warm out. There's a hole in my linwood's chimney. Did they put a temporary patch on but the chimney guy needs to come out and fix it. They don't want to turn the furnace on until he comes out to fix it, which may not be until later today or tomorrow. It was like 71 degrees in my apartment this morning. So I just wear my sweatshirt. I kind of just wanted to go back to bed but after drinking the coffee, I have one title to do. I think I might go into the office and do that. I should go into the office and be productive check mail and see if that motion came to continue the trial. I guess part of it is I feel like I should be fighting but I really don't know what to fight how to fight or I really don't know what I should be doing.\n",
            "Doctor: What does Charlie mean?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, part of it is knowing when to battle even though you're going to lose the battle and I just give up I'm like pee on it. They're going to move the trial. Oh well.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds a little like you're kind of intimidated and overwhelmed and imagine that if you do something it won't make any difference. Anyway, if you'd like you're dealing with Jess or something.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, another system. I can't win can't beat. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Although my impression is that once you actually Step Up you generally do quite well, the first part of the trial went pretty well, right and there are a lot of other things like that. I think with work when there's impending catastrophes and you figure out a way out of it or finesse it.\n",
            "Patient: One of the things I was worried about with my closings from Friday was the wires not getting there until today. I didn't want to bring that up Friday to the attorney. So my client told me they already knew you mentioned the wire had come in and I was like, I'll check with my client. She was like, oh, yeah, they're not going to be able to send a wire until Tuesday because they've got to wait for some security used to clear I think is the problem is coming from her financial. She didn't expect to pay $5,000 to saw her house Chase they suck.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, what happened with that by the way?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know just as supposed to be working with them, and I just don't want to talk about it. So I just don't bring it up.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, just working with who?\n",
            "Patient: Over the weekend. I was kind of like, oh, I've got to deal with that. I'm going to the game and I'm going to have to deal with this wire issue. It feels like I'm going to have to play the flexion to some degree. They did contact me at all yesterday. So they must have finally told them or they went to the listing agent or listing agent or they found out some other way that they weren't getting them the wire. I can't see them not getting the wire not knowing I'm not calling either or emailing that kind of stuff that kind of the stuff is the stuff. I'm worried about. I'm worried about getting an email from somebody where I'm going to respond. Okay, let me check into it and not do anything.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it that you also tend to feel pretty responsible for thinks it's weird in some ways you feel very responsible for things and another ways you don't but you do feel like you've messed up so many things that whenever there's a problem somebody's reasonably going to blame you. Because even if that thing isn't quite your fault, there's probably something else that is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think there's some truth to that. I'm concerned about how it's going to reflect on me.\n",
            "Doctor: Is there actually anything you could have done to about the wire?\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: amazing\n",
            "Patient: I could have told them Friday as I'm telling them they can't they can't have the keys The Leverage would have been for them. Oh, you're going to be late an extra day on The Wire really two days and now you're telling me you're not going to let my client in there. I just avoided at all because I didn't bring it up that was tactical on my part.\n",
            "Doctor: So it sounds like you were careful about the thing you could have been careful about which was how to handle that. But you had nothing to do with the wire being late, right?\n",
            "Patient: No, I asked emitted the money for them. I was pretty close and I gave them the heads up once I saw their loan balance was what their loan balance was how they could not take their loan balance and add the commission and realize that that was over over the shell price. I don't know. I know not everybody is good with numbers. But before they sold the place I went through and told them what the fees and expenses are going to be there were supposed to pick the sale price based on not having to bring money at closing but\n",
            "Doctor: Bright apparently not.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, it's 250,000 251,000 actually, which is pretty cheap for anything in that area.\n",
            "Doctor: So it's in this area?\n",
            "Patient: It's like a one-bedroom. It's Garden level. It's over a pond right by the football field. At the pool it runs right alongside the park so you're right there. You got the bus stops Whole Foods Trader Joe's CVS.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep, right by the highway.\n",
            "Patient: Organic sushi place liquor store. It's pretty cool. It would be a good spot for me. I'll have to think about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, maybe that's what it is and the trial as well you feel like so if I try I'm going to fuck it up or the other person is so domineering or she's going to know more or the judge is going to side with her somehow or I won't follow through with what I need to anyway. So, what's the point?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's a big one and you're myself up to like okay. This is what you're going to do and then I don't do it or I feel like I'm not going to do it.\n",
            "Doctor: Actually usually do the things work, I think.\n",
            "Patient: I took my blood pressure down and it was high. I'm off the blood pressure medication. I don't want to go back on it. But I may have to it sucks. I'm tired of all the pills. I beat myself up to get this Rush title done down while Ian is bothering me. I'm working away on at all morning. And I forgot to send it. They sent me an e-mail yesterday morning house this coming. I was like, oh I finished it last week and forgot to send it to you while I've got to get an email to them. They owe me over 3,000 now and I don't know what I don't know what's closed and what hasn't, you know, maybe I could do that today. What I've got to do is everything for me comes up by invoice number, but they've got everything by property address. So They're going to know whether it's closed or Not by property address not the invoice. I've got to go through and make a list for them that matches up the invoice number with the property address. I have no way of generating that other than manually and there are a lot of them out there. I think I'm just going to do an end-of-the-year open invoice if I'm not going to get the money until next year then taxes go up. Something's rattling your sprinkler. It's very frustrating because I kind of get like I have all these closings lined up every time the money comes in. I don't know where it all goes. It's gone. I'm trying to get to them to the point where I have expenses put away. So when I have a bad month or two, I can survive that but it's like I can't get to the point. I could not buy tickets and stuff like that. But what's that going to do for my depression? It's a catch-22. If I didn't if I don't go to the games, I'll be depressed and spending the money on the games makes me depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: I thought you bought the tickets all at once.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but still the end of EX coming up so much of it is taxes. Do you pay your estimated taxes like a good boy?\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: That's what I'm thinking about. Next is January every month starts the state and every 3 months. There's the estimated. That's the other thing. I'm trying to have money set aside for estimated taxes. Every time I try to put money into my savings account or whatever. I've got to pull it out 2 weeks later or something. At least I'm getting caught up big-time on my rent. I was really behind. I think I'm almost caught up. I think I'm still a couple of months behind but like just November and December, I think maybe I don't know. I got caught up on my student loans.\n",
            "Doctor: if for you\n",
            "Patient: Which I was in serious default. I'm getting caught up on the website. I was way behind on that. I'm still some I'm still somewhat behind on it. But there's always like I forgotten about $300 to service I didn't pay for but when I close the lawn normally I just cut the check right then for the survey.\n",
            "Doctor: service\n",
            "Patient: Yeah plot plan. It's like with these guys should be cutting me for the title. As soon as they finish the closing a check for Cameron. I try and do the same thing, but I forget which is what they do when cleared the only reason I remember it is because a check I'd written in November just cleared unlike all Buck. I forgot to pay those two. There's just always something. I'm going out for my grandmother's 90th birthday party. I'm taking you in I think my mom is going to pay for his ticket. I've got to buy the tickets. They just came down $4. I'm checking them on kayak and Ice website. I know as soon as I buy them now, they're going to drop it should be cheaper than $327. My mom paid like 280 or something like that. It's cheaper at 280. But if she's going to pay for one of them at 3:20, the question is how long I go out for I fly out on Friday. Hopefully if they're in the Super Bowl, that's the same day as her birthday party. I'll come back on Monday or Tuesday. If I come back on Monday. We're literally out there for just two days, but it's not like I'm going to be up to take him and doing a whole bunch of stuff. I don't know if I'm going to have to rent a car or not. That's what I said because I'm not that I should be concerned about how much school he misses. I don't think it's going to affect him. He's a smart kid. You can catch up.\n",
            "Doctor: Hopefully in first grade you won't get into too much trouble.\n",
            "Patient: Keep him out of trouble. I have a feeling he gets in more trouble there. It seems like Lucille is gradually more and more getting used to me.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: I can't leave every time I say I'll write Lucille. I'm going to go no, no, no, no.\n",
            "Doctor: Well good.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's not good.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, is it good that she wants you around, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel guilty though. Usually I'll leave because I'm just bored out of my mind or just I don't know we were at Cub Scouts and I had a little sing along just in case you came they were in town Lucille was just holding on to my leg. She was having fun titling behind my leg. Sometimes you would just come up and what she usually does to Jess. She's scared. So but the good thing is you want. To change diaper no mama. Okay and wanted to sleep over Friday. I was just exhausted. I can't remember why I was really against in was upset and just said I'm putting her in the middle of it. I need to come to a set schedule. I was like you asked me hours ago. You tell him then that I can't do it. I was like you can come over Saturday Saturday then buddy what she did.\n",
            "Doctor: He was over Saturday night.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, we went to a friend's house for deep fried turkey. He has a little boy and they got to watch TV the Disney Channel. He doesn't have cable.\n",
            "Doctor: That was cool.\n",
            "Patient: He gets to see the TV shows his friends talk about that. He never gets to see because he sees you seems to know these shows. I don't know where he would have seen them. Then the next morning. He spent the whole morning into the afternoon playing with the girl downstairs, which is good that he can come over and has friends there. It would drive me crazy if we were just cooped up in the apartment when we had buddy. We used to always go to parks and seem to be walking around a lot more.\n",
            "Doctor: Is he getting a little old to run in the Parks or do you still like them?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think he just gets bored quickly. So it's like the idea that he wants to go is still on his mind. But once he gets there, he still likes Wings. He still wants to be pushed like dude. Come on while we were down in Louisiana. My buddies kid had a bat and they had a bunch of tennis balls. I was throwing them some soft pitches and he was taking some swings. I was thinking that might be a good thing for us to do get him a bath and a bunch of tennis balls and go to the park. I try and do that. It's like you want to go throw frisbee. Do you want to kick a soccer ball?\n",
            "Doctor: I was at the cool little break down the other day.\n",
            "Patient: with your daughters\n",
            "Doctor: They have a lot of birthday parties. They have a whole bunch of big inflatable slides and things like that.\n",
            "Patient: I love those and used to be afraid to go on those by himself, but he loved it. I would get sick inside of those things. I don't know if it was the air or what but I'd come out and I'd be so nauseous. He was like, let's do it again. Let's do it again. They have those at the fair, which is down in Louisiana.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. You were telling me about that.\n",
            "Patient: He just starts going on them. That was a slide, but they have the big blow up.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh I can obstacle course.\n",
            "Patient: He just loves that stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Why don't we stop for now? I think I ran a few more minutes late, but if we could do. those on Friday that would probably be\n",
            "Patient: That's fine. If you need to take the time to write a letter, I feel bad that I'm giving you homework.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hey, how was your weekend?\n",
            "Patient: Not a good weekend, like really not a good weekend.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that.\n",
            "Patient: It wasn't bad today. I was supposed to read at church in about 10 minutes before we're about to leave I went to go change so I wouldn't be wearing sweats at church or having jeans at holes in them. Anyways, I started crying and I couldn't stop crying. So we were like a surgeon on the train is delayed because that's what it does. They want you to get there like a half an hour beforehand if you're reading which is really stupid. I think so. I got there 10 minutes beforehand and they already told the person who was reading the second reading to do both of them. I was really upset about that mostly like I worked me hard to get there in the first place. I would have gone if I didn't have to read.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I imagine you had to work pretty hard to pull it together when you're in the middle of the train.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and then I had to keep it together in church. Yeah, there wasn't any point where I felt like I needed to call you right then, but things are bad.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess it's kind of scared to tell me how bad that it's going instead of what happened.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I started feel like it's hard to talk about how it is in part because I don't know what to go back to the hospital. Also when I describe my reasoning out loud, it sounds strangers Jupiter and bizarre that work. There was a lot of well, I will not think about trying to kill myself right now. I'm going to watch this episode of The West Wing first. I just wanted to be over.\n",
            "Doctor: You're feeling again pretty done.\n",
            "Patient: And I know that in a day or a week or things will get a little easier and also to get my breath back. I mean another day. Are we go get this bad again? I'm getting angry at James.\n",
            "Doctor: What?\n",
            "Patient: Because I think about killing myself. And the reason I don't is that I have to think that this would do to James and I think I can't do that. I get angry at you because your way of sticking things is very slow and I'm really tired.\n",
            "Doctor: I think one of the things I see as being quite responsible reasonable in your wanting to kill yourself in the first place and also your kind of pissed off at James for getting in the way and me for not speeding things up already and you're being where you are withdrawing and how much you want to tell me about it because you're worried. I'm going to send you the hospital. I have trouble seeing this as you're being in a lot of pain and really tied up but will instead have my own reaction to it and similar sort of reasonable or wanting to know if this is how it works.\n",
            "Patient: I do know this is how it works. That's the problem. I feel like I can't get out of the cycle and I'm really tired of it part of that. Also. Is that the last few days I've been in this time and same place where I'm just in so much pain right then that I just can't think differently and I'm a little bit out of it but not enough out of it like it's going to come back and so I'm trying to kind of describe what it's like, but I'm not there now and so, it's Carter.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: but I'm not even sure why I'm trying to describe what it is. Like I think because like that's what I'm supposed to do here. I don't know maybe because I'm worried about what I'll do. I don't know or maybe it's because I know that I'm not going to go and try to kill myself, but I'm really angry about that.\n",
            "Doctor: My impression and I may be talking to True slightly different version of you here. I don't mean and some kind of huge associative way. I don't mean it like that. I got the gist of what we talked about before but what I have in mind is the part of you that's very much in touch with the things we're like over the weekend and that is in a lot of pain and wants everybody out and is very angry and doesn't see any point in much of anything including talking to anybody another part that's is a bit healthier and more reasonable or rational like conventional way of thinking about that has lots of talking or thinks that it can be a good thing. I'm kind of hearing from both of those in a way.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I just want to say that what you were just saying was that you said you may or may not kill yourself, but you're really mad about it that I get that right? I'm not saying you should feel either of those ways.\n",
            "Patient: Not sometimes that happens sometimes I think I know I'm not going to kill myself and sometimes I think that I just might both things feel authentic. There's a character in the show. We are watching Battlestar Galactica that just talked about wanting to be done in the last episode. James was like that the storyline they're going to want to develop I'm really It's really hard to watch that with James. I have a lot of things to say about that, but I don't want to say any of them to James. I don't want him to be scared for me or anxious about me. But maybe you should be scared for me when there's reason for him to be I don't want him not to be able to trust me. It's like every other thought I think what are we going to have for dinner? And then I think I wish I were dead that I think maybe we should I plasti. I wish I were dead. I want a card. James with James and Franco. I think that might be the first time ever.\n",
            "Doctor: graduation\n",
            "Patient: Thank you. I was very proud of myself and I still wanted to be dead but I was also very proud of myself. I don't know. I thought it felt like I should be finding some sort of start in there, but I don't have one. There's not really a good way to kill yourself.\n",
            "Doctor: What have you thought of?\n",
            "Patient: Apparently this is not afraid of overdosing is somewhere around 2% So I probably wouldn't do that. I think I want to jump off a building but that seems not easy enough for easy to tell whether you'd be successful. And if you weren't that would just suck balls to run out into traffic. But that seems like a pretty horrible thing to do the person driving the car probably cut my wrists or something. That's what I think about most but that again is a product pretty horrible thing to do today is because he'd be the one to find me. I just can't get out. The part of me is that things about consequences. Doesn't turn off in some ways.\n",
            "Doctor: Are the same time you're telling yourself how unbearable everything is but then you've got to be worried thread. I didn't mean there early is is a thread in the sense of likes think of this tire in yet.\n",
            "Patient: I'm worried about you.\n",
            "Doctor: In keeping with what you're saying about not being able to stop.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I may have said that before I read upon the other day by Mary Karr about friend who gets killed who killed himself has every suicide is Nashville, huh? It's pretty good, I think she's right, but I'm not sure if I can keep going I try to do I get down and I said, I don't have to worry about the rest of my life. I just have to get through the day every day. I don't think that helps very much. I think what I do need to do to make it through the day and then I have to do those things.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess I'm also thinking about sometimes it's clear when you're feeling in addition to that sometimes else. You're feeling that it is too much to hear. We're just part of what's making you rather be done.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm thinking about that. I don't know I feel useless and I'm a burden to people who love me I worry about money. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder about Gill which isn't so far from the things you said, I don't think it seems like with regard to James. You're not helping more you're dragging him down. Contributing, but he's usually pretty nice to you. Anyway, he loves you. Anyway, you mentioned also I think worrying about when the other shoe is going to drop with me and maybe sometimes it does sort of in a way with you with Gill and other words. I'm not actually reacting in the ways that you're afraid. I will which is the shoe dropping but I understand that maybe you'll kill yourself anyway.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I thought I have butts even more tentative is that maybe it has something to do with being a weekend or and we don't need?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know things got worse over the weekend, but they didn't get drastically or drastically worse. This is the way we were going.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, which I thought it was different here somewhat clear last week.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I didn't know how clear it was.\n",
            "Doctor: Is there a saying they were closer to how they were over the weekend last week? I didn't give it a traductor e but you said that it was pretty close.\n",
            "Patient: I didn't talk about it. When I wanted to kill myself this much. I'm usually hiding it from something, but I don't know what It's like if I did know I don't know if that's going to help me. Stop hiding from it. I don't know it seems worse everyday. I'm not sure why I felt I just need to do laundry. Yeah, I keep trying to wrap my head around it and it just keeps coming up dry.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. I guess you know that you're frustrating yourself by not knowing and also aware that you're frustrated and disappointed in me if we can't figure it out.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I kind of feel like you make some suggestions then I kind of said like you haven't really clicked then I don't have any better. So I'm here. I don't know why James keeps being so nice to me. I don't know why I feel like I need to have him not be the person. I see all day. Joshua said he wanted to go out for breakfast this week. It's hard all these things that didn't used to be so hard but I always hear myself that that's hard and then I just despise myself. So it's hard. So what do it anyway?\n",
            "Doctor: I'm also thinking about the stuff. We talked about towards the end on Friday. Maybe especially about the teacher-student remember?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're kind of worrying feeling I think you were talking about it being and unproductive in a way.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe that hit you pretty hard the way we were talking about it.\n",
            "Patient: It's hard to talk about I guess I feel like I build up a space or a way of being where I felt secure are felt like I did well where it felt proud of myself. I feel like I was valuable then that all just kind of went to I felt like it really did backfire on me. Now. I feel like it was wrong for me to be proud of being a person in class. He was really good at everything or to be happy about having a close relationship with teachers are like it was wrong for me to be okay with being in his relationships.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's hard for me to talk about. I'm so ashamed of what I've happened to Dan. I'm so ashamed of it. I keep trying to rephrase it to make it not quite so my fault and I just feel awful.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it helps to clarify for me how Central what happened with him is Sue how you think about yourself?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that it's just about the that how you're very close to him. And you had some feelings about certainly when you grew up in a way but also that I was sort of like part of who you are or type of relationship you sort of have a central to who you are and that in a way you are going to handle with him.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like the type of relationship I had with Dan before God I had was pretty much the same as the types of relationships that I kind of bored myself by at least once I was in 9th grade really before then 2 then I feel all of this. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, we should stop for now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: How are you?\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: How are things it's been awhile.\n",
            "Patient: It's been a while. I guess I'd say I'm anxious more than anything a lot. But I guess overall things are okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You said you got a new monster guy?\n",
            "Patient: So I try the first couple were really bad. So I tried to think of one and I don't believe it and it sounds horrible, but it's going to be okay things are going to like that. Sometimes it's interesting. But sometimes in my head, I'll still hear the like I hate myself immediately and I can't like but then after that I will think it's going to be okay from trying to like hopefully eventually the first one will be erased and I won't think that but it's really ingrained. So\n",
            "Doctor: That's what I think part of it is just even to get start noticing how awesome that. Compson comes up in your mind how much it's there as a whip, even if all you're doing in the beginning is just noticing it more how ingrained you're saying that is that it comes in. Is that exact statement specifically?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, always.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: It's always that and it's like a daily think if not multiple times a day. So it's going to be okay sounds like it sounds a little wishy-washy R. It sounds like the type of thing. You don't want to hear when you're upset like oh, it'll be okay almost like brushing it off, but you can be a little comforting even to just try to believe it or even just to hear it after that instead of that. They can do a little good.\n",
            "Doctor: You said you tried a couple of other things first that didn't stick at all.\n",
            "Patient: I didn't intentionally try them. It's just like they came into my mind.\n",
            "Doctor: So what but that they didn't work like it didn't feel.\n",
            "Patient: No, they weren't good. They were not good.\n",
            "Doctor: Like what? I'm curious what came out first.\n",
            "Patient: It was like a I guess it's self critical thought I was looking at someone else. Actually they are on the team and she just looked like so put together and so and I was thinking about myself and thought of the I hate myself and then I thought she's better than me then I thought that's not good like comparing that that's not a good strategy. Then there was another one that had come into my mind actually not remembering at the moment.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like sort of one Distortion coming into replace another Distortion more than a challenge.\n",
            "Patient: Right, so it's going to be okay. It's I don't know if it's that great, but it's better for sure. I think it's at least not anything negative and I find it at least triggers like a it's not the end of the world reality.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, yes.\n",
            "Patient: Because I find the I hate myself. It doesn't just come up in the course of a day it comes up as I think about something can trigger a memory and I think back on something I did or didn't do or Saturday. I didn't say whatever and I noticed that I hate myself like comes so it's not even like if everything goes well today, I can guarantee that that's not going to come up in my mind. It's more like\n",
            "Doctor: interesting\n",
            "Patient: My thoughts can go there.\n",
            "Doctor: even by just seeing somebody I'm a team in other words. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't say anything wrong.\n",
            "Patient: Right, but not even just that like something will trigger some kind of memory and I'll think back and it could be years ago. It could be weeks ago. It could be something I did or something I didn't do or just something I was embarrassed. It could be a little thing. It could be like an actually significant thing and then I hate myself that will pop into my head. But it but if at least in that situation. It's going to be okay. It already happened. It's over. It's not the end of the world like so\n",
            "Doctor: It is a really interesting thought you're that you come up with because right on the face of it. It sounds almost invalidating. It's going to be okay Ramona stop overreacting or something. But I think the reason you're saying it might be doing something that feels better is it does like when the thought I hate myself comes up in a way triggered by tremendous anxiety. In other words. What's it's not what's not on it's very obvious. I hate myself can be a start of Selfridge self-critical spot, but I think that what's less obvious but actually is functioning. A lot of the time is that it's a thought that you have to manage your anxiety. You know what I mean? So you start feeling you can start feeling out of control. You can start feeling like you'll never Get to where you want to be. You can start feeling like I'm not going to get a job. I'm not going to get an A and that I hate myself that kind of whipping yourself back into shape becomes a way of kind of getting control of a situation that feels out of control.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, no, I definitely yeah, it takes control and it puts it all on me and it just a minute becomes like I hate myself and if I change this and like maybe then I won't hate myself so much. Maybe then the problem won't exist. Maybe then like so I definitely like it's very it's a atheme I'm seeing here is that it's very important for me to have complete control over the problem whether or not is actually related to me.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: And I think it's also a way to deal with shame to deal with Mike. I don't know depression or anger run an issue because I find it to be I found it to be so incredibly unproductive to get angry at the person was actually responsible. I just lied know where it is made. No progress. No success. It's been invalidated even that it's their fault, of course bringing it back and putting it on myself his felt like the only way\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, this is the only outlet for all those feelings some of which is actually meant for people out there.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: originally\n",
            "Patient: right and I\n",
            "Doctor: And it doesn't go anywhere.\n",
            "Patient: No, it doesn't.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, right. That's what you had to do.\n",
            "Patient: It still feels that way though.\n",
            "Doctor: That is what you're having to do a lot of the time at least.\n",
            "Patient: right, and it's\n",
            "Doctor: with Ivan\n",
            "Patient: It feels like in fact if I could turn the criticism or inward a lot of the time even if it's to criticize like don't be so critical. Even if it's that it feels like that's the solution. I'm also noticing more and more lately. Maybe it's I don't know. It's a couples therapy, but it's also in general but I don't feel like I'm allowed like I'm not supposed to be critical and that's one thing but I don't feel like I'm allowed anymore to speak about the elephant in the room. To acknowledge them not to critique them not to bring them up confrontation Ali or even with like, hey, we have to talk about this eventually on top, which there's this other lawyer where Ivan's family is like by and large in denial about what's been going on and he's avoiding those topics like the plague which is I mean connected to the problem. She has a kind of stopped even talking about any of it with them because they're like so really a lot of the time doesn't feel farfetch from you to say actually, I'm the problem. And if I really didn't bring it up really didn't criticize it really did Let It Go the problems really would go away.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I totally get that.\n",
            "Patient: So it's like I'm the only person in the universe who thinks that there are actually problems and until I deal with my stuff, I'm never going to have any progress and it feels that way with my parents. I mean, it feels like it feels that like it's likely more than likely my perception alone, but it feels like instead of looking for accountability in them. I need to be looking for like letting it go for myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know the story of The Emperor's New Clothes? Do you remember that?\n",
            "Patient: I used to I don't really anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: It's an old fairy tale. It reminds me of that. So there's a boy that the essence is that of the story is there is a boy who sees that The Emperor's New Clothes is that he's naked and he's going around to stay and everyone look at my beautiful expensive clothes and everyone is an acting as though he has beautiful expensive clothes how beautiful your lovely no one is saying a word and the little boys only one who says we don't see these naked he has no clothes on there's no one around who's confirming that because they're all they're all thinking in the story probably just came kowtowing and placating to this emperor that reminds me that you're the only one if your left yourself in the system is like especially I think you're not here and we're not talking about some of the reality and have a benevolent boys coming in to say actually this isn't okay. What's happening in Ivan? You're the only one who sees it. I think that's how it feels right now. You can't even I can't be spoken about it almost becomes unreal, then if your parents can acknowledge, it Ivan's parents can acknowledge it Ivan can acknowledge it. It sounds like dr. Ferro can't is it always acknowledging it as real see you start to doubt your own experience. Maybe it's just me. Maybe the problems. I mean, I don't think that's true, Ramona.\n",
            "Patient: But there comes a point where I wonder if it matters if it's true or not because it's that comes back to it's like it is with my parents. Does it matter anymore if they really were in the wrong or if I really could have taken care of things better. They're not going to change and I'm not it's like there is it almost feels like there isn't much point in coming to the like look like progress in theory for me personally to say like there are some things that are my problem and are my fault that I do need to deal with but there are also things that are not my fault and I didn't cause them and\n",
            "Doctor: I hear you as a child. There was no point to come in to that conclusion. That is for sure as a child because you know, you probably tested it over and over again or Moana. We know you did away. Maybe this time you can clean the all of your pleadings your tabs. You're saying maybe if I say it in this way or do it this way or do it for them? Maybe they'll catch on you've tried so many different ways of getting through to them and none of them worked. So you learned over time. It didn't make any difference to label their problems as their problems. It did not make any difference for your experience, right? It didn't make things better for you. They didn't change as a result of your saying it.\n",
            "Patient: Well, and even if I had really labeled it as their problem I was never going to tell anyone. So it really was still didn't exist in my mind. I mean am I clearly supported like this isn't your fault but\n",
            "Doctor: You're otherwise so alone with it. You're not going to a group of friends and saying get a load of what my parents are doing.\n",
            "Patient: and I don't know if that would have served any purpose. I guess the point is more like and it feels like a very repetitive thing with Ivan. I would never feel comfortable telling a soul. Maybe it's even my fault that I'm stuck alone with that, but it just doesn't feel very good.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, the question is that we've been trying to think through and get to understand is whether Ivan is exactly like your parents are not if he's exactly like them and that they no matter what you say. When did they wouldn't change if that's who he is you were stuck with the same thing and that is sort of like we have to sit is beating your head against the walls try to kind of get him to change cuz that's never going to happen. And then we got sort of changes our conversation. What do you do with that that what do you want to do with that? What does that mean to you? If this is always going to be this way. It's never going to get any better to degree that to the degree that he's maybe like them some but has more potential for change that would invite us to thing. Okay. So what how do we help you in the time that he's changing? How do we find? Is there a third option besides getting angry at him in a way that it feels like you're beating your head against the wall because doesn't do any good. Returning that anger back at yourself because I think that also destroys you is there any other room for anything else in between those places is the question if there is room for him to change.\n",
            "Patient: So that's I guess I don't know how to describe it. But I'm noticing Ivan is making Improvement and he came home the other day and told me how is Bostic him aside and thanked him for stepping up and how he's been doing such a great job and he hasn't gotten any compliments or critiques from work in a while and I really happy with him. She's made a lot of progress. So that gives me hope it gives me a lot of Hope and that's really good. And he's felt more confident and he's like\n",
            "Doctor: It's helping him.\n",
            "Patient: Of course, I mean, of course, I would feel good and the other night I came home from volunteering and I was just really tired. And anyway, it was like dinner time and I even knew I was on my way home, but when I got home the table set and he had made dinner completely it was maybe I don't know just a little bit. He did all of that on his own. I didn't say like can you please have dinner ready by? No. I mean he really set a nice table.\n",
            "Doctor: You don't came up with the idea.\n",
            "Patient: And he really went to effort and organized himself. And so I mean there are moments like that where he completely surprises me and then there are other times when I just feel kind of it's nothing big that's happening, but it's like he sleeps in really late and he still hasn't done the laundry and he still hasn't taken out the trash and still like It's not personal but it feels personal and it feels like a trigger of like the sounds so silly but it feels like it feels a little bit like my mom who would stay in bed so late.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not silly at all.\n",
            "Patient: So late and who inducted me not do those things around the house. And then there are times when I know I'm always still like so I then the apartment kind of needs to be cleaned up straightened up to some extent every week. Do you want to pitch in can you do even part of the bathroom and it still. Portion of asking him to do a very small part of a bigger task that should be in this case a joint responsibility. So why is the majority of it always on me? It's like when I would clean the whole house and ask my mom if she could vacuum the stairs and she wouldn't I mean she wouldn't do it. But I know that's it sounds I guess like overreacting but it really doesn't feel that way and then it triggers me in the what about all these big problems that we're not talking about. Almost feel them. I don't know. I don't know. What a good way. It is to express it. But and couples I feel like I've been squashed kind of because I'm not we're not talking about any of the big stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: who said that they stuff I have an idea, but I'm curious what your feeling like is the biggest elephant in the room and you want to talk about\n",
            "Patient: So I feel like we spend a lot of time building communication skills talking about things like that. And that's great that's important for everything, but we're not talking about we never really talked about how much the whole thing with grad school. Actually that is an issue. And we're not talking about that. We're not talking about all the drama with his loans that he just didn't open mail for a year when I'm talkin about actually the ways in which the depression and stuff like that really is like I don't know how to say this without sounding like the worst person in the world, but some of his some of the actions that result from that or the inaction is problematic and it's not that I thought about it the other day and then my head once I finally came to a statement that clarified that I thought I was going to sound like the worst person in the world and then when I actually heard about heard it in my head I thought maybe that's not so horrible. And it was just that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, what?\n",
            "Patient: I wish you wasn't depressed. I wish my mom wasn't depressed. I don't want.\n",
            "Doctor: That's an understandable thing to wish for.\n",
            "Patient: I don't want that and it sounds like it doesn't sound quite as horrible as I thought it would.\n",
            "Doctor: No.\n",
            "Patient: But I just thought I hate it. I hate that.\n",
            "Doctor: It's really really hard to live and put up with it and tolerate someone who's depressed for a long time that you care about.\n",
            "Patient: It's\n",
            "Doctor: straining\n",
            "Patient: it's draining, but it's all so I guess I've never even felt like I was allowed to label as depression with my mom and a lot of the times with Ivan labeling it as that is not And my mom never liked growing up. She never at one point explain to us what was going on with her a lot of the time it would be masked in a y Mastin Ally of physical ailment. So she was physically sick right before church every Sunday. She was fine. And then she was way too sick to go to church and it was always something Clockwork every Sunday Saturday night. She was sick and she wasn't sick and I was so angry because my mom was lying to me every single weekend and I knew she wasn't sick, but what I didn't understand was that she was struggling with Agoura agoraphobia and she was depressed when she had her own bike anxiety stuff and I like I guess I wish I don't clearly know nothing about being a parent and I don't know what\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, you do, you know some things about what you would have done differently if you were her.\n",
            "Patient: I guess me but I don't know what it is. What is is it fair to him and expect that at any point? She would have explained what depression is or what she was dealing with or why staying in bed or staying in your PJs all day long is not instead of being really defensive about it the entire time that's not normal.\n",
            "Doctor: It's harder for me imagine that if you went through about a very severe depression with a child that you might not say something differently. Then she said to you.\n",
            "Patient: I don't.\n",
            "Doctor: So you couldn't get out of bed.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know again. Like I just feel even to the day. I don't feel like I can say anything about it to her. I don't feel like I can say much about it to Ivan and I feel so frustrated because no one in my family is going to say like Mom I'm worried about you you're really depressed because she'll get exceptionally angry and no one and Ivan family is going to say like, I know you're struggling with this. How's it going? Because he's not depressed. He's brilliant. He's not having any\n",
            "Doctor: It's such a repetition for you.\n",
            "Patient: It is and I feel I guess I feel. Evan is sometimes made comments to the effect of like I'm not your parents. This is not me and I'll say no, you're not you're you and it makes me so angry because I get from him saying that I get the impression that I'm just overreacting and I'm projecting everything that my parents did on to him and it's so unfair and I just really need to deal with it and get over it. But in reality a lot of a lot of it is a lot the same.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, so sometimes people say see things in other people that aren't only a little bit there and the thing things that are a little bit they see really big because of their own histories why the timer Moana people end up for example, marrying someone who is just like their parents or parent a caregiver who actually like that because that is what familiar and safe unconsciously. You don't know you're not like people go Do that on purpose but this is why someone who's beating a child. I've said this you marry someone who beats her as an adult. That's not what's not that she's pretending that's happening or she's protecting projecting onto her husband that he's beating her up. He's actually beating her just the way she was beating that was a child. That's really happening. So it's my experience again. I don't hear Ivan's side of the story, but I do hear even still I've met him once I hear through both dr. Farrow and dr. Board. This is really happening in him. I think the only places you get stuck around it are actually are around signing with that third option might be besides desperately and being enraged and critical of him and desperately being enraged and critical of yourself. That's what the legacy of your childhood with your mom in this instance and Dad. Because your dad also wasn't speaking up saying Ramona. Your mother is really severely depressed. This has nothing to do with you. The reason she stays in bed. All day long has nothing to do with you. I don't want you to take responsibility for it. I'm going to hire a housekeeper so we can get some help around the house. Right? He wasn't also standing next to you saying the emperor is naked. I see it too. So this Legacy it leaves you only with the option you had either to just try to get through that to them desperately or to put it back. All in on yourself is the way of getting control. You don't have internalized inside you how to negotiate the differences and disagreements and problems. Feeling like you didn't have to turn it all in on yourself. And you also could have some different kind of patience and love go around it to like it would have been so much better for you. Had your mother said to you. I'm so depressed. This is something called depression. This is what it's called. This is what I'm doing trying to get myself into treatment and get better. This is nothing to do with you. I don't want you to feel responsible for me. I love you so much. I wish I could get out of bed, but I can't that would have been really different even though she still would have been depressed. You see what I mean? Just in Communications. I'm holding in mind your mind and still trying to take care of your mind needs even while doing that and I think that had that even that happened even if she still has severe depression you would have been able to say okay. This is my mom and her problem and I'm not happy. It doesn't mean you and the depression isn't a problem. It's still problem if she's lying in bed all day long. That's not good for any person right so you could have your reaction. Also not have it feel like your whole sense of yourself revolves around what's happening with her you could feel free to kind of feel good about yourself regardless of what's happening with her and I think that that's was still stuck in with Ivan, but it's hard to kind of feel like you see what's happening with him and have some reactions to it feelings about it and frustrations and disappointments and have what's happening with him not totally impact your sense of you. Does that make sense?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I feel like I've made a tiny bit of progress with that to some extent. I don't think by a large Ivan is not doing like he's not. I don't know. He doesn't talk about it. He doesn't really acknowledge it and I don't completely blame him for that because I mean he's I'm really the only person I mean Really the only person outside of doctor board and Doctor pharaoh who has any like who's ever going to talk with to him about it right now in anyway, and I just know the other day he got off the phone with his parents and they were finally going to like no no send the like insurance reimbursement. This is like 5 months later and I'm like Ivan. That's pretty that's a long time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, it is.\n",
            "Patient: And I'm like, that's kind of.\n",
            "Doctor: That's really happening, Ramona.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: What's a real 5 months?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know and I'm like Ivan, that's not and I told him I didn't think that was okay that he could feel and he was pretty sharp with me after he got off the phone and pretty angry with me. And I said, so did you tell your parents that you felt a little frustrated about this or did you tell them how you felt about it at all? And he's like, yeah I said it was a little frustrating and I just occurred to me. Maybe it's not a coincidence that he's really angry with me after he's getting off the phone and raising his voice and maybe I didn't do anything wrong. Maybe he's really angry with them and that's okay, but I still feel really frustrated because I wish Actually think it would be a really healthy thing if he could find an appropriate way to tell them that he didn't that he did feel angry or that he like that. It wasn't maybe super acceptable to\n",
            "Doctor: You're so right and it's also so good and healthy that you could for that split-second make that connection that maybe he's not actually angry at you. In fact, it's safe to get angry for him. One of the things that means is that you're like the safe Outlet. I know that's not exactly the fun to be and a safe place for somebody to angry. But that means your relationship with him isn't a different maturity level and the relationship he has with his parents where it's not safe from those feelings are just found the outlet in you but they're actually meant for them. They're the feeling and she couldn't Express in them.\n",
            "Patient: I know I just it's not fair and clearly I do not have a perfect in relationship with my parents. But I guess I don't know. I wish Ivan would confront. I mean arale would confront even me he can get angry at me and yell at me to some extent which is almost like\n",
            "Doctor: And that's the new right?\n",
            "Patient: right, and it's\n",
            "Doctor: That's pretty now.\n",
            "Patient: Sometimes it's good that comes out in a really kind of uncontrolled way because he is it's like he has no clue how to do this. How do you get angry with someone? How is that ever? Okay. I just wish maybe that he that could never happen. But I know his parents a lot of times have told him he's just being moody or he's like you just brush it off and that's just Ivan. And that's just and I guess I wish I told him it's okay to get angry and I said even if they can't handle it, even if they can't handle even if they aren't going to respond appropriately it's okay to say this is really frustrating or just to get it out to some extent.\n",
            "Doctor: I also wondered if as you were telling me the story The only piece of the anger that might actually have been for you and maybe this is just the way I heard it. But the way you said it to me it was that you said to him this Ivan. This is not okay what they're doing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he doesn't that's not like.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that so I just wonder about like if you said Ivan that I feel I'm sad for you that feels like neglect abuse Ivan 5 month. Do you know what I mean? In other words picking up on your own empathy for him instead of I might hear if I'm him. I might hear you saying this is not okay as a kind of rude of him and an attack of his parents instead of the we are actually feeling also is like wow for a second how poor Ivan to it is certainly not okay for you either because this is affecting you but I had to put up with this his whole life. Also this kind of neglect.\n",
            "Patient: It's just it's hard because I find my absolutely I find myself getting angry at them and I know there is no way he can't get angry at them and he can never say like I'm angry with my parents that would be way over the top for him. So clearly he's not going to respond to me saying that about them. He's not going to respond to that. Well, but I don't know it's hard because I want him to be able to express that and I also\n",
            "Doctor: I just I guess I'm wondering if you might have more space to feel actually to start to feel his own anger. If you were to say that. I'm sorry. Do you know what I mean? But it actually gets his experience gets validated and gets to its it gets to grow from within him. I think when he hears you getting angry and he gets scared. He just gets scared at anger. I think any sort of clams up and goes inside and that got angry back at you in a way the essence of what you're saying is that this is really not. Okay. It's very poor treatment of him is neglectful.\n",
            "Patient: And I've tried to it's more I guess it's my opinion, but I tried to tell him like even if your parent it seems like his parents actually struggle with a lot of the same stuff that he does. It's not entirely like you develop these problems on his own.\n",
            "Doctor: No.\n",
            "Patient: I think a lot of them were shown to him to some extent.\n",
            "Doctor: This is Cason point.\n",
            "Patient: So I tried to like even if like it's okay to say you're angry at your parents like they really procrastinated or whatever and it still say you love them and they're your parents and they're really important to you. It's okay to recognize that are flawed and still. Things are also just feeling I guess pretty hot right now around that subject because I was talking about visiting my parents toward the end of the summer. I really need to get my car inspected anyway, and I need to go to Louisiana. So we're talking about that and I'm just feeling like overwhelmed and I already have a mental list of projects. I want to do at my home at home and it's just really hard to talk to my parents on the phone. I'm really hard to like. My dad is trying to give me job advice and my mom is like\n",
            "Doctor: You have a specific time you supposed to go home.\n",
            "Patient: We were talking about the end of August because Emma has a little bit of vacation time. So maybe taking a long weekend.\n",
            "Doctor: So that she'd be down there with you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and Ivan, may or may not so that's like I'm already so worked up about that.\n",
            "Doctor: What are the projects you're going to do at your parents house? meaning\n",
            "Patient: I mean, yeah, I'll I mean I will clean to some extent obviously that's always the other day. I was just talking to her on the phone and saying like maybe will we will be coming home within a few weeks or whatever and I just casually like so how are things going at the house and because selfishly I kind of wanted to have a heads-up and what I was going to walk into because it really ranges dramatically and it's really hard to drive 8 hours and not just like walk in the door and have no reaction no matter no matter what it is. It's really hard to do that but asking is like a recipe for for disaster and she's like first thing out of her mouth was you Dad gives me no help I have to so who knows what it's like And they just took in another pet so I'm really angry and really dreading it and really like I want to see my parents. I love my parents, but it's so hard to go home and not say a word about everything that's staring you in the face. So yeah, I have a list of things. I want to do it on there and it's just like\n",
            "Doctor: So what would be like Ramona to?\n",
            "Patient: the go home and not\n",
            "Doctor: Say Actually I don't even care if you make the list and then you rip it up and say I'm not doing the things on the list. This is not my home. It is not I'm not living here. You have to spend I don't know what 3 4 5 days there.\n",
            "Patient: yeah\n",
            "Doctor: a week\n",
            "Patient: no I mean not that long but\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, long weekend, and then you're back to your home, but the energy into your house.\n",
            "Patient: I felt really bad because my mom said I'm not sure it's as clean as your apartment and it was almost like it was an insult it wasn't like your apartment is really nice I'm not as fussy know it was an insult it's like I'm too picky I'm too even though if you're at the house is really disgusting and if I suggest that needs to be cleaned you have to have it perfect you have to have an Immaculate its again like I'm imagining the problem but Emma has suggested like it's she got really worked at the other week when we talked about it because she said she doesn't know she feels torn because they need help with things to some extent but she also just wants to spend time with them because they're getting older but also just we don't want to go home very often we don't see them very often to just actually have quality time with them\n",
            "Doctor: When she says they need help with things does this mean they're actually asking the two of you.\n",
            "Patient: so\n",
            "Doctor: When you guys come home, can you do this this and this?\n",
            "Patient: there is one thing that my mom is already been asking about if we could help with.\n",
            "Doctor: With what?\n",
            "Patient: So she has maybe a hundred nursing uniforms. She was a nurse off and on for a while and she hasn't worked in years now.\n",
            "Doctor: 100\n",
            "Patient: No, she probably has a hundred. I mean some of it she's never worn.\n",
            "Doctor: how\n",
            "Patient: Because she has a problem with shopping but she yeah, she probably has a hundred. I mean, they're all just like in there multiple huge container ship them. And so she wants to sell them. She agreed to sell them and I said, but if you want to sell them you can't go buy new if you decide that you ever want to like maybe you want to keep just a few or maybe that has to be enough, but she can't control I've learned to stop trying that but she's like, yeah, I guess we should take pictures of them and try to sell them and so part of me had like a little moment. We're mentally I thought like I wanted to almost say to her you can do that on your own. That's not my job. Using a camera or uploading to be online? That might not be the easiest or most intuitive thing for her. My mom is 66 but I just had that thought you're grown up. So your uniforms you can tell them I had that thought and I would never say that to her and clearly if we go home I will have her do it, but that's one thing she asked for so Emma said well she asked for that so we can do that, but maybe we should leave the rest of it go.\n",
            "Doctor: Will she get a lot of money for these then their new? I don't know.\n",
            "Patient: Some of them are new some of them have barely been warned. I mean they're all in perfect condition.\n",
            "Doctor: Are there a lot of money?\n",
            "Patient: She spent a fortune on them. She might not get I mean she probably won't get half of what but better than just donating all of them.\n",
            "Doctor: And then what will she do with the money?\n",
            "Patient: I don't want to know I don't want to know probably buy more stuff for spend it on the pets. No, it's a problem. It's an actual problem.\n",
            "Doctor: She like shopping.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, absolutely. It's a really really it's a really big problem.\n",
            "Doctor: What else does she shop or is it closed?\n",
            "Patient: She has a couple thousand bucks not like she has a lot of books how isn't that know she has a couple thousand legitimately and she keeps buying more.\n",
            "Doctor: That she reads to.\n",
            "Patient: She reads a lot.\n",
            "Doctor: He's a reader.\n",
            "Patient: But she has a mean of them. I don't know what percentage she's actually red. I mean she keeps buying more even if\n",
            "Doctor: And she's not going to the library or something.\n",
            "Patient: She goes to the library. Sometimes she says but when she came up to visit she spent more time than anything than anything. I feel like in bookstores so buy big bags of books.\n",
            "Doctor: seriously\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. So she didn't go see where Emma worked but she went to bookstores. Sorry. That's like a really rude to say about your mom.\n",
            "Doctor: That is not rude.\n",
            "Patient: But I'm bitter about it clearly.\n",
            "Doctor: You can go to a bookstore anytime. You're here to visit your daughters.\n",
            "Patient: No, she shops to it's definitely a coping mechanism for her and everybody has Mike opening my coping mechanisms are probably equally bad in two ways. But it's a frustrating thing just like they found a stray cat and now they're taking it in and I said, so what are you going to so what are you going to do about that? I just like trying to for the millionth time with them to coax like maybe just find it a really great home spend some time. And because you have 20 pets, but now I set him up and you're still in your sister's room.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh my goodness.\n",
            "Patient: I'll be fine.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh my goodness.\n",
            "Patient: And it's just like it's horrible because it makes me cringe inside and I should be able to let it go but it's like it's really like all that on the table. It's hard to just go home and not say anything at the house is a mess and not saying anything if they took in yet another pet. I'm not saying anything if my dad comes home at midnight from work. It's really hard. I end up right back in the child role of coaxing and cleaning and very much bargaining.\n",
            "Doctor: So what would happen about it? If you decided that you're not going to help with the projects around the house. What do you is something going to happen while you're home? Will they get really mad?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't actually sound like they would it's not like you're demanding you do this.\n",
            "Patient: no, she know my mom has said and my dad to some extent that they feel bad that we come home and help and I think it's just really hard for a lot of reasons because there's the whole like it's always been this way Emma and Emma and I have always cleaned it up since I mean since we were very little\n",
            "Doctor: It's hard to break out of that cycle.\n",
            "Patient: it's really hard to let it go and it's also like my dad is in his late 50s. My mom is in her later 60s. It's like it's not getting to the point that even if they say there's no depression. There were no marital issues. they were there were like\n",
            "Doctor: Some help.\n",
            "Patient: of course and they have a 1616 room house. They have a big house and they have 20 pets and he has a whole business that he's the only like they really could use some help and I really and there really are some projects. That would be overwhelming for Emma and I let alone\n",
            "Doctor: Sure. The only thing though is here's what I'm feeling about where you are now as a child affect your daily life. If you didn't if you couldn't find a pathway or if there are dust bunnies everywhere Arthur's color everywhere. It was affecting your sanity your living space your comfort you had to do these things in order to keep up with your own life. You now don't have to do that at that house.\n",
            "Patient: no, but it's still it's not just it's never been just about what Emma and I needed Emma has tried to tell me like just clean your and there were times when she came home from college and she cleaned her room and she stayed in her room and she let it go and my mom would say that she was lounging on the end of spine and pretty much call her lazy because she wasn't\n",
            "Doctor: Really so she would do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and I don't think she ever had the idea that other people came home from college and had a break and their parents made dinner and their parents clean the house and they weren't lazy.\n",
            "Doctor: Are they came home to a fairly clean house?\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: massive undertaking\n",
            "Patient: like normal amounts of helping out as opposed to\n",
            "Doctor: cleaning the dishes that kind of thing.\n",
            "Patient: so Emma has done that. Emma has suggested that we do that. She's like, you know, what instead of taking on all the projects. She's like, I know there's still some stuff in my bedroom closet. I should just stick with that if I want to go through like that. That's fine. But she's like maybe we don't need to and she said maybe we should just try to coax them to do some fun things or go out to dinner or go out kayaking with my dad because we always say we'll do that but the other there's so much but the other thing is even if we sat around the house and ignored everything which would feel impossible and probably would be impossible.\n",
            "Doctor: hard\n",
            "Patient: my dad is not like\n",
            "Doctor: home\n",
            "Patient: he's not going to take off. He's not going to get coverage while we are at home and he is on call 24/7 and he schedules a lot but he also gets a lot of emergencies and he travels and he does Alabama and La sushi ya. I mean if he comes home early, it's like 7 or 8 at night. That's so early for him. That's he let my mom will say he does that when you're home and it's like it feels like crap. And my mom will stay in her bedroom a lot, even if we are home and it's not like she doesn't care that were there and Emma says even if they're not there with us the whole time they like that were there and I think it feels good to them that we even if we don't do a ton even if it doesn't look like what a visit would look like to us. It's just it's so complicated.\n",
            "Doctor: They might like that you're there, but they're not actually showing that they're really enjoying and making room for spending time with you.\n",
            "Patient: I mean they are in the ways that they're able my dad coming home at 7 or 8 at night. That's huge for him.\n",
            "Doctor: That's crazy. That's so messed up.\n",
            "Patient: usually it's 11 like usually\n",
            "Doctor: my goodness\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh my goodness.\n",
            "Patient: No, he like work. I don't ever say that. My dad is a workaholic and that he works a lot.\n",
            "Doctor: really addicted to work\n",
            "Patient: No, like we're talkin 7 to 11. He's gone.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: It doesn't happen as much on Sundays because people don't want to schedule stuff on Sundays. But I mean he's still and then it's like paperwork you should be doing paperwork. So it's like never anyway, so that's coming up in just like something I need to do it. I need to like do some personal work around that but also I got an email from my mother-in-law saying we want you to come visit August or September still make it too long like until you get there and it's so awkward because I haven't sister just got back from Europe. She was there for a year and they didn't talk for the year. I invited her. I'm like we should sky and she\n",
            "Doctor: parents\n",
            "Patient: No, no, no, no, no. his sister and Ivan did not\n",
            "Doctor: She was gone for a year.\n",
            "Patient: No, they just like didn't really ever like on Thanksgiving the phone got passed around and I think he said hi to her this is it in several times. I messaged her and said like we should set up Skype or something and she just never really liked so I let it go but now she got back and I'm like so neither of you are going to acknowledge that you haven't even like talk. No, no one is going to acknowledge it no one is going to\n",
            "Doctor: Are they in a fight?\n",
            "Patient: No, no.\n",
            "Doctor: There's not some tension going on.\n",
            "Patient: No, I mean there's definitely tension with her and me. No, they don't fight. They just don't talk to each other.\n",
            "Doctor: You're so alone.\n",
            "Patient: And now they want us to visit but his dad also in the same breath asked if they could visit so I'm not sure what's but I'm just like so now we were talking about when we go home to visit my parents. I've been going to a nest driving up to New Orleans for part of that time and coming back and I'm already thinking like, I don't know if I could handle everything at home and then go up there and every everything there and then\n",
            "Doctor: It's like graduation all over again.\n",
            "Patient: right, but 30 hours of driving and\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I got to the top of it.\n",
            "Patient: Saudi anxiety is pretty high plus I'm thinking like I cannot face any of them. If I do not have a job and I'm feeling really anxious and crummy about that. So anyway,\n",
            "Doctor: Well, we're going to have to stop let's prioritize talking about what I'm going to ask you to think about this week might be a reasonable set up for goals and extra cheese for you to set up for yourself for a visit home with your parents and by that. I mean I'm suggesting to you. All right, what if you're strapped the list and you kind of look at me like Not a chance that that's happening. So maybe that's not reasonable and realistic. Maybe that's asking too much of you know what I mean? That is just this is so ingrained in you and even your sister to do this. That what would be something that would be challenging to yourself to try something new around it a little bit. What would be something like it carves out a little bit of space for you and let go of the piece of responsibility. It might look something like maybe you say okay, we will grieve for a couple hours on one of the days. We're going to sit down and help her take photos and put stuff up on eBay or whatever that would look like. That would be the project that we tackle that we won't tackle some other like cleaning up the garage or whatever would be the other kinds of things that are running on your list that you'll agree to one but not an endless. I'm at you and your sister might then try to say we would love to if it would if we could somehow do it XYZ together. I don't know what that would be kayaking going to movies going out to dinner communicating that To your parents and even maybe a green with each other, even if your parents don't show up in whatever capacity that you and Emma do that you enjoy your hometown together. You do something sure your vacation together. And again, this is just one iteration of what that could look like, but just trying to think about okay, how do we get a little bit more space for new adult Ramona to not feel quite as responsible because this actually doesn't impact your daily life anymore. It's going to impact weekend. But you have your independent life now, you don't it's not your household you're living in and you can start to try to press a little bit into letting go of some of that. Does that make sense to think about it? I just want to ask if there's room for you to do this one this week. If you notice a time or two or three or the statement, I hate myself comes out. Could you write a little bit about where you are and what's happening how that thought came up just kind of put context is so we can get a couple it's partly for us to talk about but also partly for you to really get like what are the feelings is a shame. Is it anxiety is it? I should be going on but doesn't have Outlet out. So it's turning back on myself. That's driving that thought when then what happens when you say it's going to be okay even using it at home. It's going to be okay. We're going to figure something out that's going to protect you a little bit not a lot. Maybe not a lot yet but a little bit so that there's something new starting to grow about the potential in you and just right just a few. Down a few details. If you want to email it to me. That's cool. If you want to bring it in bring it in cuz that make sense.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Good to see you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi.\n",
            "Patient: Yesterday went a little better eventually.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: Sometimes I have something to start with in my head and I have a couple of likes cars running in my arm. That we're almost faded into my arms are getting tan and I've gotten much darker and that's bothering me. But oh, well, I don't know what I'm going to do. I feel like when I want to hurt myself the knowledge that like that is not going to go away necessarily doesn't actually isn't enough to keep me from doing it away from us, but like well socks and I have scars all over me sort of preoccupation about it. You know when I think that I like some things in life are never going to go away. It's just going to be what I look like then I feel like I should either find some way to get comfortable with them or find some way to talk about them about like I've got two although it's never going to go away. So there's not much Orijen see about that. I just find it embarrassing because like I self-insure and I'm kind of embarrassed about it like it's just you and I must, you know thing I've ever done and I can't sort of like pretend I have done or I don't know because it's right there in front of me all the time. I guess. I just worry that people like will always see it as unstable in the way it has been. Guess I'll just have to wear sunscreen. I was at a party with and\n",
            "Doctor: is that a\n",
            "Patient: White wires and so there were a lot of kids running around everywhere and there was a kiddie pool set up until it was like everybody putting our bathing suits and sunscreen in the whole process and somebody told me like the pre pre Tanya time. For damage that would lead to skin cancer in life is like 0 to 5 anyway, so I'm screwed. I don't think I put on sunscreen until I was at least 10. Oh well. I mean, I guess that is good that I actually am thinking about myself in 20 30 50 years, but not necessarily that hopeful peaceful thoughts. So my church has decided that this coming year is going to be like the year of the Bible and they're going to focus on actually reading the Bible which actually could do that much and especially like the Old Testament because there seems to be a general consensus that no one really knows what is in there anyway, and it makes them kind of embarrassment, So, you know, I think that's a good idea and I've been anxiously turning over in my head whether it should offer to help in some way because I actually do know a lot about that Old Testament.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And I don't really know it's a big church still like program like these have like amazing hierarchies in bureaucracies. And it kind of like said that this was we're going to do and no one said anything else. They're not like going to start it up in September and I don't know if I'm ever going to be here on September 3rd of excuse I hear myself making but it's really anything involved with the church. I felt like two days working myself up to sending an email telling the priests you preach this week that I like to Sturman and I'd be like now he's really not going to be upset about like to hear that. They do things. Well, no, it's fine Tanya. It's a little weird going. So my the church I grew up in is also called calorie, which is weird because Calvary I think is kind of weird, but it's like whatever but I was not liking some place. I felt comfortable like the space. I was really comfortable in like both in like Sanctuary like the church in Shelton like all like the whole area. I just played there a lot because we let literally across the street from it. And so we just ended up playing like in all the storage closets and things which I'm sure we really fine for the people who actually wanted the store thing there but whatever. But like I never really felt comfortable with any of the people that I remember it was weird. So I'm not really good at about remembering people's names as a child. And so there we were like this whole the third of the congregation. I never knew their name and I saw them every week and I known them for years and I was supposed to know their names and I don't know their names and I couldn't say who is that person without I basically solve that problem by leaving town and now I just I like fuck it. I'm not going to be embarrassed about it. Like I'm asking people's names when I forget that because otherwise I'm screwed. We're going to have a year-long relationship and I don't know who they are.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It's like how I know some parts but like how much bridge and a congregation run like really intimately in some parts to scare the shit out of me like talking to other people, you know, it's really nice to feel like I really know people in the car when I go home and not talk to anybody else cuz that scary.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: you know and also because like worship is usually a pretty like emotionally heavy time for me and it's so it's hard for me to\n",
            "Doctor: I imagine it matters to you.\n",
            "Patient: snap out of it. Yeah. I'm trying to remember like anyplace this world come from and I guess I remember like the Cavalry I grew up in the congregation as being very cool in some ways.\n",
            "Doctor: You said cool.\n",
            "Patient: You know when you grow up in a vest Street not best rated Vestry is a place where people that are the executive order in the rectory, which was across the street, which is belt. I think in like to 1810 so it's like a big old plantation style house Scott. I like a dog run and it was just like sort of a shuffle actually it was maintained well at all in some ways it was fine. And in some ways it was not fine and like, you know, there was really no, you know, it was a really old house. There are no central air cleaning up all of course. I like it would get so hot in the summer and my bedroom is on an additional. So if you have much hotter than the rest of the house because it was like it was either brick or stone that the house is much cooler than it had any right to be in general. My room is like 5 degrees hotter than anywhere else and I would guess so hot that I set up a fan right at the end of my bed and it would still be so hot that I couldn't sleep. So I get a bowl of ice and just like there was no fan in the bathroom. So there was a mold all over the ceiling and I got to be this very heavy intricate pattern mold and I remember just being in the bathroom looking at like who this is interesting look at the pattern. Eventually at some point Maya. What I realize that most people's bathrooms like when that happens just repaint but that's isn't really what happened for us like our dog. That was a German Shepherd was deathly afraid of thunderstorms was like, I like tired of answering a thunderstorm last couple of banister rails and like that never got replaced ever. So water made me throw up.\n",
            "Doctor: drinking water from the top\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it took me a long time to notice the connection that if I drink a whole lot of water, I would throw up a couple times. I minutes afterwards and I like Scott. With everything but that was because it happened to Tim not because I happen to me because it was said and that wasn't really listen to it all and it was because we had well water and the wild Hunt contract or like wasn't be maintained properly. And then right before we moved out they sound like it was like a storage place in Fond Du Pre much every year and they're like, oh there's dangerous bull down here. We need to fix it because boys meet you and I was like, that's where we used to play in the summer because it was too hot upstairs. You know, I think part of that and the thing is the housing block on my dad belongs to the street and they weren't responsible for the upkeep.\n",
            "Doctor: They were responsible.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, typically apart of the priest salary. I mean these days this year we're from those message and they have included a stipend for housing. But it kind of like traditionally the priest lives in the rectory and then the Vestry use directory up or the church does the church's responsibility and so like I don't feel so good about that, you know, they started doing repairs the last couple years we lived there but I think it was because I started to realize that my dad was going to be there forever and I needed\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But you know, my dad's part of me says that. Was also the way he was raised like that was the way his parents like his parents house was like that but much worse except the house. I lived in as far back as I can remember was newer so they didn't have stuff like the structural kind of things but none of the dishes were ever clean sort of thing. Well if you just didn't notice no, no, he should not have noticed. So like going to church is really important to me being a part of a church or something. That's a little more not necessarily a Caring Place.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, they can look after protect you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And then here, you know, I can't really look after I text you from any of these things that happen when you're talking about that.\n",
            "Patient: I mean your job is sort of the opposite. There's a phrase from gaudy night, which is when I really like\n",
            "Doctor: Who wrote it?\n",
            "Patient: Dorothy else tires. It's a mystery novel from the thirties. The female protagonist has been anxious with the mail Pro, you know, she's sort of in love with this guy but like he doesn't want to get married because she doesn't want to be in a position of being limited for a limited by your husband which looks like protecting and is afraid after a letter she gets that he was being about as protective as a can opener. I like that a lot.\n",
            "Doctor: That was pretty evil kind of actually.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, she's a great writer.\n",
            "Doctor: There's a famous quote from the 60s early 70s who said about analysis that like it's the job of people sort of stand there pain, which was in direct opposition to what the rest of the medical profession was doing.\n",
            "Patient: I like that.\n",
            "Doctor: I think what a demonstrate about the can opener. Well a bunch of things. The first one is very solid.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess so.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, especially in that context.\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry I'm trying to take this seriously and it's getting increasingly difficult yeah I read that book a whole lot probably 10 times and I don't think that ever occurred to me\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, it's not just a metaphor about the context.\n",
            "Patient: absolutely\n",
            "Doctor: He's going to a guy.\n",
            "Patient: yeah yeah it's like the correspondence is important for the character that she realized this is part of her being like she like basically one of the questions of the book is how do you reconcile the life of the mind with relationships particularly with your woman and your so basically like she sent him like she's a detective but she's the one who has been commissioned to solve this mystery she likes him a letter saying hey I'm working on this problem and it's like getting increasingly dangerous to see how it goes and he writes back and says basically well it seems like you're doing really good work let me know if I can help and that was the opposite response than she expected\n",
            "Doctor: Which is something about his sort of like.\n",
            "Patient: Let me step in and take care of this for you.\n",
            "Doctor: And also feels like me.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: I can also be like me.\n",
            "Patient: So as soon as I said that I was like, oh wow next to talk about the context and that's going to happen up a open up a whole can of worms.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I know. I don't know. I don't know. Like I'm not sure how much the contact carries over for me.\n",
            "Doctor: I think there's quite a lot in that in the other thing that makes me think of it is your scars.\n",
            "Patient: So I don't have to have this reaction where you say something in the conversation where I'm sort of like well, I don't know if that's true. But that's just really elegant whether it's true or not seems to be really secondary 200. That's a really good idea. I guess I'm sort of dodging the question now.\n",
            "Doctor: No, my impression is that what's going on is what we are reenacting or image for a little bit and then I'm saying things I feel a little like uniburners, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you feel not protected or safe but anxious and kind of cut into in some way. Answers to have a feel of when we are talking a while ago like them or contraction and yet I think you were stepping back and Away saying that's not what's going on. But I think in terms of how it feels to me, it's kind of like that.\n",
            "Patient: I don't think well see here's the thing. I don't think talking about this guy is like I think the analogy breaks down or the image breaks down because like I caught myself so I don't have to do this. This is my Charter and more painful. I don't feel like cutting myself is to exert some control over the situation and I feel like this conversation is filing rap for the out of my control.\n",
            "Doctor: I think part of what you're saying is that all this feels the same the damage that you're describing including the Sun including the moldings winning the other things from when you were small and they're cutting herself and talking about it. I think part of what you're saying is it all feels the same like it's supposed to be protective. It's supposed to help you feel better. Like when you were a kid, you're supposed to be protected you weren't I feel those things go together, but I The church was supposed to protect you from all sorts of things in your father was supposed to protect you and look out for you and how and said it was sort of the opposite. They dangerously neglected you and The Cutting is supposed to be like that as well as supposed to sort of provide relief and I know that in a way it does.\n",
            "Patient: but now I have to deal with the scars that open the app to\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, exactly the kind of thing that you were trying to avoid by cutting yourself, which is sort of exposure examination question. And here's you you came for help and was stuff like I mean I moments like this.\n",
            "Patient: yes. But in some ways it's like and so this is where I like to see the masculine plays until like in some ways. This is also like this kind of discomfort is very familiar.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Well, it hurts a lot. So I must be doing something right.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, right.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and then some sense you kind of arranged it that way really?\n",
            "Doctor: How do you mean?\n",
            "Patient: Well, you consciously would choose the cutting as a way of coping something that has a kind of narcissistic quality or experience that you may not choose consciously, but as like a can opener like I think you're exactly right that there is because what feels familiar is what gives you the impression for some reason that you're doing something right? I don't know what the alternative is.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean in practice there are tons of Alternatives. Can you use some of them for example cutting isn't the only way you could\n",
            "Patient: sometimes I just stare at\n",
            "Doctor: sometimes you just stare at my point is that\n",
            "Patient: what's what I like I meant by not clean specifically but like I don't it's hard for me to like imagine if we inhabit the mental space to somebody that didn't think that way I didn't have this whole approach to wanting help and wanting comfort. I can't imagine what it's like for other people. Which I'm usually pretty good at that sort of thing.\n",
            "Doctor: It really is not in the capacity of like sort of the Neurosis or something in the way that this all praise for you. It's hard to as opposed to your not being imaginative. I think the thing is that arranging things in this fairly optimistic way, usually with the kind of immediate and sort of kind of naive hope that it would just make things better. But that's what I've also makes it hurt a lot and an expensive problem with having there is sort of like some of the other ways you roll it something you seem to do like when you were tracing\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It seems also the part of it involves a sense that the other person your church or your dad or me, like in the immediate moment. The feeling is what we're supposed to be there to help you so that you can come out looking. Okay. You don't really get what's going on or what we're doing to you and your kind of usually the way you arrange Things become out looking. Okay. This is a lot\n",
            "Patient: Yes. You know, it's a little more challenging for you that is when it's in the other for like other people in like but it's pretty clear to me that you have a better sense of what's going on in that for instance. My dad ever did or ever will.\n",
            "Doctor: haha\n",
            "Patient: So it takes a lot of transfer unit trust an assassin.\n",
            "Doctor: We should stop for now tomorrow.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Where do you want to start?\n",
            "Patient: I know it's not time to symbolize depression yet, but I think I have what would be depression if it were happening consistently for 2 weeks.\n",
            "Doctor: What's going on? What are you feeling and then I want to know when it started.\n",
            "Patient: I'm feeling like a water time. I'm having unsettled thoughts more like wanting to hurt myself non-fatally thoughts. Really easily like overacting to something small going wrong.\n",
            "Doctor: So you're feeling really irritable.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, irritable anxious a lot of the anxious anxiety uncomfortable feeling. I'm not I'm not crying non-stop. So I don't know. It's like when I had depression and I knew it was depression sophomore year. I was crying Non-Stop and it was this big feeling like sort of a cloud over me, but it was more of a physical feeling it. Was there pretty much the entire time. That's not really there.\n",
            "Doctor: How often is this year?\n",
            "Patient: Most of today yesterday mid-afternoon, so I didn't wake up until 12 p.m. Or something. So I hadn't been awake for that long.\n",
            "Doctor: How long have you slept?\n",
            "Patient: 10 hours or something. I think we were up pretty late. We were up until 2 or something. I also felt it last week Sunday and Monday and Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. I was okay. I sing a little bit mad at work, but it wasn't such a big deal that I needed to leave earlier anything. It was just getting things done. That's what that was. The only one of the two days though. I think maybe that was actually the week before I think it was mostly okay at work last week.\n",
            "Doctor: So there are good days a couple of good days in a row and then a couple of bad days.\n",
            "Patient: I know depression is more consistent than that.\n",
            "Doctor: Typically a more common descriptor of depression is having those really low feelings pretty consistently. Nobody has a textbook people's experiences don't fit into boxes perfectly. What's really important is that you're feeling badly more frequently than you're comfortable with and more frequently than we would help. I'm encouraged that you have days where you get a break from those feelings, but I don't want you feeling really down a couple of days a week.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not really sure what to do.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know what makes one day a good day and one day bad day?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure because it usually starts mid-to-late day. Saturday was fine. I even went out walking for a good two and a half hours.\n",
            "Doctor: Saturday was a good day.\n",
            "Patient: Saturday was a good day. There's nothing bad that happened yesterday that triggered it.\n",
            "Doctor: You just had this feeling\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, maybe it was more in the evening. I wasn't I wasn't very good at things like sitting made dinner. I couldn't even go to the grocery store and get ingredients for dinner, which is something that I would normally be able to do.\n",
            "Doctor: when you say you couldn't what were you feeling that stopped you?\n",
            "Patient: Lots of anxiety, I guess I could ask as a physically made myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Some more anxiety than sadness or lethargy.\n",
            "Patient: True. It wasn't really able sargi. I wasn't feeling well sarjak. I was just feeling sad and anxious. Maybe it was sadness and anxiety. It's really hard for me to be clear on that on even though it was a day ago. I should really I should remember it really well.\n",
            "Doctor: When you're not feeling it it's hard to recall what you were feeling.\n",
            "Patient: I'm also things that I need to take note of in general. I think my brain functionalities talked right now. I don't know if I'm actually getting stupid or something, but I'm a little bit slower not remembering things not remembering all the things but I'm a little bit slower and not remembering all the things.\n",
            "Doctor: Not remembering what your feeling or are you finding yourself forgetting?\n",
            "Patient: I think little things like I know it came up yesterday or the day before and now I can't even remember what the example was, but it wasn't something normally I would have caught and didn't\n",
            "Doctor: Are you forgetting this show up places where you're supposed to be?\n",
            "Patient: That is not happened. I'm so good at scheduling all the things.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you find yourself losing things?\n",
            "Patient: No worse than usual. It's easy to lose things at Sydney's place. But oh, I think I know what it was. I was trying to figure out moving. So I had on Friday finally called the movers Peter and Barbara recommended and they said the stuff for September 1st looks up and by the beginning of August, but it still mid-july. They were actually booked through the days before in the days after and they gave me two other companies that was around lunchtime on Friday. And I forgot about calling them. I was in the middle of dyeing wool. My purse is upstairs in my hands are covered with dye. So I didn't have the numbers then by the time I was done with that. It was after business hours. So I had to wait until today there was that was something I normally would have been able to remember and would have done it.\n",
            "Doctor: But you got distracted.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, then I wasn't even feeling sad I had to die.\n",
            "Doctor: You felt good enough to be productive and die the wall.\n",
            "Patient: I had to die one thing but then I decided to die for scanes of yarn while I was at it. That was even when I started feeling good things that I normally wouldn't forget.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, that's something easily distracted. You mentioned having thoughts of self-harm. Can you describe the thoughts for me?\n",
            "Patient: Mostly just me and then comfortable feeling my brain telling me that if I physically hurt myself it would feel better.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you have a particular way of thinking about hurting yourself? Just a general hurt myself not do something specific.\n",
            "Patient: Sometimes it might be flashes of cutting myself. But in reality, I have a weird sweetness about cutting skin, so I wouldn't do that. I think it's more of a you need to hurt yourself in order to feel better.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you ever done that?\n",
            "Patient: Nothing more than briefly digging my fingernails into my skin. Not even though even not even enough to puncture. That was a long time ago. Nothing that would actually hurt myself a little bit more than temporarily.\n",
            "Doctor: You don't act on it, but somehow the feeling passes because you're not feeling that in the moment now.\n",
            "Patient: Eventually, it just goes away at the same time that the anxious uncomfortable feeling goes away. Then I no longer feel like I have to hurt myself.\n",
            "Doctor: What have you been taking formats?\n",
            "Patient: I have the 85 mg of Does superior mean and my birth control pill vitamin D vitamin B complex and that's only in the morning in the evening. It's the 75 mg of Seroquel and 25 whatever. It is milligrams of Klonopin.\n",
            "Doctor: And have you needed or wanted to take additional Klonopin? That's all your regular regimen?\n",
            "Patient: It doesn't really occur to me, I guess because of specially when it happens at night and I've taken my night time meds. I'm like, okay, I just took the Klonopin if it's not working. I don't think a second one would\n",
            "Doctor: So is that something you've never discussed with your psychiatrist? Is it okay for you to use additional Klonopin?\n",
            "Patient: it's okay for me to use it during the day or something. The thing is a prescription is worded such that I can take it that I can take another one heard a part of me thinks it will interfere with my morning driving and come here.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it make you tired?\n",
            "Patient: It used to when I took it eventually I would get used to it. But the whole getting used to it. Seems like it would be too much of a hassle for not that much reward. I don't actually know if it would make me feel better during the day to take a Klonopin. I don't even know if a Klonopin is working at all. I can go back to Xanax, but it seems like she's not much of a fan of that.\n",
            "Doctor: o u r\n",
            "Patient: Especially if I'm going to be any up taking it every day or something Klonopins unless it is less addictive. You know, that is something more regular to make things not as bad in the first place. Maybe it is working as well as it can is just not enough time seeing her Friday. Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: These are maybe good questions to discuss whether or not it would be useful or beneficial to take more to take some of that additional Klonopin sort of on an as-needed basis or whether it would be better to switch to something else. These are good questions for discussion.\n",
            "Patient: I just don't know what to do. I think nothing is really helping and I've gotten to the point that I'm not sure anything else. Would I also found out that it turns out that October ish of one of the Jenner generic producers of Wellbutrin produce some bad batches that was right around the time that I was having trouble with the Wellbutrin. I don't know. I don't think if it's enough to know whether that would be worth it to go back on Wellbutrin, especially because the disputer mean works with panic stuff in the Wellbutrin doesn't I think the welder chain was before then two then again, I usually like taking the generic one. I don't really have my old pill bottles so that I could go on then.\n",
            "Doctor: See what backed you were at.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know if the pharmacy. Because that would be a lot of information to hold on to 4.\n",
            "Doctor: I really don't know about that.\n",
            "Patient: It's entirely possible that the Wellbutrin wasn't working because it was manufactured in correctly and not because it was an effect of my body. So I don't really know. I just thought I've just gotten to the point that if I'm medicated and still feeling depressed and there's nothing I can do there very few options left to me because we tried the mood stabilizer and that gave me weird side effects to it really seems like Wellbutrin and disappear mean are the two drugs that are for depression and have absolutely no serotonin side effects, unless you get to the crazy stuff like the maois those are kind of scary and they're kind of clunky and I don't know if they'd work any better than despair mean.\n",
            "Doctor: In what ways do you feel like your medication is working?\n",
            "Patient: I know that I go crazier when I'm off my birth control and not as upset and anxious as I would be if I were taking the placebo pills for a week. It must be doing something because I feel anxiety. I think my OCD would be a lot worse. If I wasn't on Seroquel, it's usually there a lot of stuff that that I talked about a long time ago, like the checking after flushing toilet usually doesn't happen so much anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: So that's a difference in your daily life. You're having to combat things like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, maybe because I'm not feeling depressed every single day. My antidepressants are working to some degree because maybe if I were off them, I don't know if I was on the end of them if I would completely beside all the time or if it's just that my depression only shows up some of the time and they're not doing anything.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. It's not really an experiment to want to do this is not a controlled study.\n",
            "Patient: It would be a really bad idea to just go off something off of everything.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: Just the fact that I came up being sad for no reason and it's breaking through means that my drugs aren't working enough if I'm having these bad feelings for not being triggered by any certain thing.\n",
            "Doctor: So you're not happy all the time.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but Saturday in usual though.\n",
            "Doctor: So you do feel like this is worse than whatever your Baseline is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, usually my Baseline would be if I'm sad there's no reason for it. There's a reason for it. Maybe you could should still could be the stress now. We're finally staying over at my place more so that\n",
            "Doctor: o u r\n",
            "Patient: Yes, Susan got mad at Sydney for having me over so much. I sent him an email and he kept on telling me it was okay. So I got really mad at him for that. That he would let it get that far. Therefore. It was insensitive for him to have us actually spend more time in my place.\n",
            "Doctor: How is that?\n",
            "Patient: It's okay. I got the AC in the room. So now it's livable again. It's a little bit annoying in terms of having food that I actually like to eat around and we still haven't made a trip to the Hamden. But if we go out to eat meat to eat for meals and stuff, then it's not such a big deal. My room is chaotic, but it's not as chaotic as before. So it's like I can sleep in it without it being an issue. Then I get to do all my errands stuff that I need to get done. We were there last week Wednesday night Thursday Friday during the day and then one day his place you're going to come back on Saturday night, but I didn't but it didn't happen and neither did Sunday, but I think that will do this. I think what we'll do is spend Thursday night Saturday night and Sunday night over at my place on a regular basis. That way I don't have to keep food for work in two places. We're over at my place a fair bit. Also Susan after she said that she's on vacation until the 14th. So she's not even around right now.\n",
            "Doctor: She said you were really angry at Sydney about that.\n",
            "Patient: Because he kept on telling me it's okay. It's okay Susan something angry email to Sydney, but I feel like she was also mad at me and I wanted to not have this happen the first place the fact that he kept on telling me nobody Minds.\n",
            "Doctor: It's really uncomfortable feeling to have someone be angry.\n",
            "Patient: I sort of feel I felt sort of betrayed by that. I wish you had done more thinking and actually had talked to people to see whether that was a problem rather than just a shirring me that it wasn't a problem when it actually wasn't problem.\n",
            "Doctor: And he actually believed it wasn't a problem or you think he did it.\n",
            "Patient: She was all like they understand I'm depressed and that's why you're around a lot. I was like, yeah, but you had the conversation back in January. That was a long time ago. He thought it was fine.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder how that impacted your mood this past week.\n",
            "Patient: A lot but I don't think it would be the reason that I'm depressed after that all happened. He did say at my place for a few days that could have been why I was depressed on Sunday and Monday, but that's not why I'm depressed now. I also found out more stuff about my job. It turns out that the grant goes until December. I guess it's flexible enough so that it's not like if I do end up finishing everything really early they can find other things for me to do and I can stay until December talking to people on the internet. They think I should start my job search now, And I guess somehow mention in the cover letter that I'm working this grant right now. I'm not sure if I should tell them that we'll be done in December or if I will be done in September October which is when I would finish all the work at that I was hurt you.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you feel about this new information?\n",
            "Patient: I feel like I should be applying for jobs again, but then I felt depressed again yesterday and today so I haven't I looked at one of the job sites in a lot of things that I found were going to work one that sounded really good was a temporary summer summer position and I don't think I could take. That time off from work and then go, you know things like that that wanted starting now and I was vastly under-qualified for the one that's on a really cool except that it was in Newport. And that was a 3 hour each way commute and I was like nah, I'm not doing that. I can't do worse commute that I'm currently doing. I will go crazy.\n",
            "Doctor: You have to move to work on Newport.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not getting on Newport. That was the only that was only one job site. It's the one that has the most jobs on it. I guess I'll go back to the right 3 cover letters and applications are weak if I can plan. I don't want to leave them way before I think I'm not sure if they expected me to stay until December or they expected me to stay until I finish the work and could stay on longer in those find more work for me, I guess because I'm not quite sure how to have that conversation.\n",
            "Doctor: You're apprehensive about it.\n",
            "Patient: A little I'm not sure if any of the people at the library in the museum. know any institution Center closer to me that might be looking I feel like if they they really did that then it would be a good way to go because everybody in the museum thinks that my work is really good.\n",
            "Doctor: What is the great things about doing this work was to work in the field and make contact and start developing relationships with people that actually know your work.\n",
            "Patient: They're all the way out in not that it would help but I've worked with an awesome archive. The archive was the only one who did all the digitization for them for free in return for being able to keep a digital copy of everything they digitized but that would mean more steps because of the archive in order to work there. He has to be in our arrested in I'm not making another move to all right, that's just not happening. I don't think I've ever seen a physician at the archive that didn't have a residency requirement. It's really frustrating because I see jobs from them and I'm like, that's a cool job 08 residency requirement.\n",
            "Doctor: You have to live in RI proper.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, you have to live in RI proper.\n",
            "Doctor: That's limiting and frustrating.\n",
            "Patient: The people who live in or I can apply for all the jobs in New Haven and Wallingford and stuff but people who live in New Haven and Wallingford can't apply for RI. They be innocently rejected unless our cover letter had something that they could move to. All right for the job. I wonder if having a PO Box in RI would be except that would be a PO box and they know that so I don't think I have any friends who live in our a proper who could pretend to be living with I feel like that's the kind of thing that with taxes and Social Security if you do they be able to find out. No, I'm just sort of like I think I can do my current job with a depressed amount. I feel as long as I can get myself in the car and drive to work and drive back. If I start working slowly and me and said I'll be working at probably the level that they expected me to work in in the first place. So that's okay. I'm not sure about applying to other I guess I have to wait for days. Then I'm not feeling depressed to do the applications holding out something full time now seems scary.\n",
            "Doctor: You said scary and what I was about to say was I here for your creeping into your voice from other conversations that we've had. It's my belief that anticipating something scary being afraid feeling like you're not going to be competent or do something feeds into your episodes of anxiety or depression. Whatever we call it in the instant interesting makes you have anxiety and depressive symptoms. So I'm wondering how much of what you felt this past week is fueled by having your timeline laid out for you. The new information about the job didn't really speed up the timeline of looking for a job that actually sounds like they'll find work for you for a little bit longer than you may have anticipated. But at the same time that you started hearing about that or taking about that it sounds like you are you also got some advice online that you should be doing your job search now, I'm wondering how much that piece of advice that you got kind of got you ramped up and got you worried. Got you scared and got you feeling depressed because you did not like the job search process.\n",
            "Patient: No, I really didn't. I don't know. I can't go back to being unemployed. I need to have something right away.\n",
            "Doctor: Listen to this fear.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know my parents will.\n",
            "Doctor: feeling trapped\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: feeling trapped may be feeling judged by your parents worrying if they're going to be angry.\n",
            "Patient: It will only support me on certain conditions with stuff which would be really annoying. I don't know because it wasn't like I was thinking about any of those things when I was feeling sad.\n",
            "Doctor: We can't really know exactly for sure.\n",
            "Patient: Because it was happening before I found that advice to I think that I think I got that advice over the last couple days. I think I had the conversation at work this past week which would mean that the depression that I felt on Sunday Monday was before I got that advice. I didn't ask for the advice until I had the conversation. I don't think it's just that I think I can handle even though I should be starting now. I feel like if I wait until I'm at least packed up for the move if I wait until I move it will be less bad because I can devote two weeks. 2 days a week or two it or something.\n",
            "Doctor: You feel less overwhelmed. I don't think any one thing that happened in the environment or an event that or an event that happens causes feelings of depression, obviously anxiety and depression is something that you've struggled with off and on over the course of many years. There's not going to be one particular thing that causes all the all those symptoms. The way that you tend to respond to whatever stress life is full of stressors. And what seems to ramp up your symptoms is how you respond to whatever stressors there are whether it be having to look for an apartment having to look for a job feeling angry at a boyfriend feeling uncomfortable in your house having tension or conflict with your parents. These are all particular stressors that can go on in your life. What tends to make you feel better or worse is what control you have and how you respond to whatever stressors there are those dresses can be things that can that can ongoing and chronic or something more time limited like the move.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I guess I'm just thinking that it's brain chemistry in the drugs aren't fixing the brain chemistry. Even if I didn't have it be stressors. I might be feeling just as bad and it's just my brain not working and there's nothing I can do about my brain chemistry. I feel like the only way to control pain chemistry is thermae meds. I don't know how much trying to think differently would change that.\n",
            "Doctor: What what do to the idea of brain chemistry?\n",
            "Patient: Because when I do feel a depression, it's not usually from thinking about any of those dressers is just out of nowhere. Nothing that I can think of is actually triggering it. Maybe there are times when I got more upset like when I got upset with Sydney on Wednesday night about the now you tell me that your housemates don't want me around as much. I'm instead of listening to me months ago, but I was definitely a reacting to the normal amount of I shouldn't have been reacting as strongly as I did as I have and I think Is it been in a better place? I would have been reacting as strongly as I did those are triggered, but the rest of it comes from seemingly nowhere.\n",
            "Doctor: out of the blue\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's the part that makes me think his brain chemistry and I guess because I'm thinking if it were or just life stressors that it wouldn't be nearly then I wouldn't be nearly as upset as I am.\n",
            "Doctor: because it feels out of proportion.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I shouldn't be feeling like wanting to hurt myself for wanting to kill myself for many of those things normal people have job searches and moving and all of those things and don't feel suicidal. They might be sad or overwhelmed, but they're not going to the point of wanting to kill themselves because it would make everything else easier.\n",
            "Doctor: That's about wanting to kill yourself or wanting to hurt yourself. Those are thoughts.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm in complete agreement with you that some of these stressors that you just listed are things that for a lot of people wouldn't cause this level of distress and that's why we call it depression because you are feeling intense distress about things that for many people like you said would be upset and it might feel overwhelming but it wouldn't feel this intense.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, especially since I found a place so that I'm not even worrying about that. There's a little bit of moved a parts that are stressing me because I've tried two companies and one was going to be for September 1st at 2:48 an hour. With a 6-hour minimum, which was going to be over $1,000. I'm pretty sure that my move can be done in 3 to 4 hours the company that I did end up going with I tentatively scheduled for August 30th, which I can cancel up to six days before I know then whether or not I can move in a little early because my new housemate mention that it's a possibility, but he's not sure. If not, I haven't asked yet. I tried to call him but he's not answering whether or not I could stay an extra day to see if I could get a September 2nd move and if they were open then I don't know if he actually has people coming in or if they're coming in on that day. So there's a little bit of stress there, but that didn't even come up until today and that wouldn't have affected things yesterday and not for that long. I guess if worse comes to worse, I could just rent a truck and have friend stay with me. It would just suck a lot. So I'd rather avoid that if possible. I look at my stuff and I'm like maybe I don't actually have that much. I need to pack. It's not very well organized. I think it's my brain chemistry, but it seems like the only logical explanation. That's the only thing that would be possible for me to be this out of proportion upset to things that are stressing me out.\n",
            "Doctor: And you feel like you have absolutely no control over that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, maybe I could take a little more Klonopin, but I don't think it's going to be enough to have any lasting effect. Dr. Barnes when I asked her before she doesn't really think I could go up more on the despair mean and that she didn't think that going up would actually help it's really hard. When I feeling is Miss World to want to go out and exercise and do stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Stuff that changes this mysterious brain chemistry. There's no way to measure things that you hear about on drug commercials and on TV and they talked about serotonin levels and norepinephrine. There aren't really ways. We have to go in and measure what levels are or what the right levels are. It's an idea, but there aren't really the specifics things to do change mode for sure medication is one of them we kind of know from working backwards people take these drugs and have a lot of changes in their moods the other things that change mood or things to do. Are things that do take some of the motivation and energy things like exercising exposure to light?\n",
            "Patient: I've been having the sun lamp and using it especially because Sydney and gotten me a little mini orchid plant because I had seen them in the grocery store and thought they were so cool. You'd gone grocery shopping a few days later. So the mini Orchid because of that. It's like it needs to have partial sunlight and we have in the middle of the room and not in the window. So we use a sun lamp. I also have it when I'm dying wool. So that ends up being at least sunlight.\n",
            "Doctor: This time of year you tend to get enough anyway.\n",
            "Patient: I haven't actually gotten around to looking into it there some sort of sun lamp type thing that I could expose myself to while driving that wouldn't hurt my driving ability.\n",
            "Doctor: It might not really be necessarily because when you're driving is that early enough that the sun's not out.\n",
            "Patient: No, but it's just like I'm I feel miserable sometimes when I'm driving and maybe that would make me feel less miserable.\n",
            "Doctor: But you're getting exposed to sunlight already.\n",
            "Patient: true\n",
            "Doctor: And so I don't think that that would. If you're driving when the Sun is up, there's enough exposure through being in the car.\n",
            "Patient: plus it's a rainy day.\n",
            "Doctor: That's true. But for the most part being up and being out of the house, you're getting enough of that during the time of year this time of year, but that probably wouldn't make a difference you getting enough to be adequate just because you're up and out and you're in a car that has lots of Windows. Yes on a very gray overcast day. You might not but for the most part in summer, most people don't have no defects in the spring and summer due to lack of light absolutely talk to Doctor Barnes on Friday about medication issues the things that you have control over or exercise, which we know releases endorphins and thoughts, which might not cause a feeling of depression, but they can exacerbate it or help to alleviate it somewhat it's not saying that what you're thinking is necessarily the start of the symptoms, but it's something that you do have to you do have control over that can push it in One Direction or the other. We may not be able to prevent every symptom or every episode of depression. Our goal is to reduce the frequency and alleviate some of the intensity that you feel.\n",
            "Patient: It's just really hard when I get to the point of wanting to hurt myself. It's not hard to prevent myself from hurting myself, but it's hard to\n",
            "Doctor: To get Beyond safety. So, you know where you can keep yourself safe but to get yourself to a place where you actually feel better. That's where I really want you to be. I'm of course very glad that you're safe and that you don't have any attempt to act on these thoughts, but I do really want you to feel better.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I don't really know what to do when I get back bad as soon as all like you need to fight those feelings. I can't just be there like the one to argue against you.\n",
            "Doctor: Does he argue against you?\n",
            "Patient: He will he be like know everything is going to be okay. You don't need to kill yourself.\n",
            "Doctor: Does that help?\n",
            "Patient: Not really. I told him that he doesn't have to argue against me. He wants some sign that I'm fighting it in later after the conversation. I realize at the sidelines of that is that I'm not actually hurting myself and doesn't that count for something.\n",
            "Doctor: so he doesn't really want to fight against it and you don't really want him to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but he still does it anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: Is there something else that you could give him to say to you that would maybe be less taxing for him and more satisfying for you.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm not sure what he could say. If he could just give me hugs instead of telling me things like it's going to be better. I told him before if you tell me it's going to be okay. I'm going to argue against you because you're saying something without proof. Can you stop saying that?\n",
            "Doctor: And then you end up intensifying your own thought because you end up saying what you were already saying again, you're reinforcing it because you're fighting against him. I wonder if censoring yourself a little bit to get yourself the response that you want because when you tell him that you feel like killing yourself or you feel like hurting yourself, he's going to say it's not that bad. Don't do it, which doesn't make you feel better. You know that you're going to keep yourself safe. So you don't really need him to tell you not to do those things because it sounds like you're very clear that they are very big thoughts that you're not acting on if there is ever a point in time where you feel like you might act on them and you need to tell someone because you need them to take steps to get to some safe place. But if you know that their thoughts that you're not going to act on maybe what you want to say to him is I'm feeling really sad. Can I have a hug? I'm having a hard time right now. I'd feel better if we could cuddle. Maybe those are the things that you need to share with him.\n",
            "Patient: That sounds like it would work. Yeah, I don't know if he'd been be okay with me so crying, but that would at least be better.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, maybe that's a plan to try thinking about what you say to elicit the kind of response that you want.\n",
            "Patient: I just figured it would probably be impossible anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, let's give it a try before we decide it's impossible.\n",
            "Patient: That would probably help.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like what you want is some comfort not an argument.\n",
            "Patient: I told him so many times if you say that that's not actually going to make me feel better. Can you stop saying that?\n",
            "Doctor: But he doesn't know what else to say. So he says it so if you can tell him what you want, I'm sad. I'd like a hug. Can you hold me?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah specially because it's going to be okay something that works on him.\n",
            "Doctor: But it's not going to work for you. You need to speak each other's language, you know what works for him and you can give him what works that sounds like what you need to do is give him something that works for you that he can feed back to you if that's hugs or just sitting together then that's what it is. I'm glad we figured out something to try that might help.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think it should work. Hopefully I won't be at a point that I need to use that but I'll probably will considering that today that even today. I'm just\n",
            "Doctor: And you don't have to wait for it to be really bad. That's the other thing.\n",
            "Patient: That's true.\n",
            "Doctor: Asking for a hug doesn't have to get to a point where you want to hurt yourself for before you ask your boyfriend for a hug.\n",
            "Patient: best room\n",
            "Doctor: If there's ever a time when you don't feel safe, then you call me if I can't answer then you call the emergency room, but it sounds like it's not him who you tell about those thoughts. Especially if you know that they're just thought I know that they're uncomfortable to have but they don't need any action if there's ever a time when the thoughts turn into something that do I need action and you need someone to help you stay safe. Then you can either tell him that I need you to do this or you call me or call Emergency Services.\n",
            "Patient: there have been a couple times where I've been like maybe I do need to go to the ER but I've never gotten to the point where I've actually\n",
            "Doctor: Will you really needed that?\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you know yourself. Well, I trust that ultimately you want to be safe and you take these the steps to do that right now you've got Right. Now you've got your way of expressing how badly you feel give it a shot. Don't wait until it's really bad just practice asking for the hugs even if it doesn't get that bad so that we can train him to give that kind of support that you actually really want and let's see how that goes that I think we will then I think we meet next week at the same time.\n",
            "Patient: Do we have the rest of July schedule?\n",
            "Doctor: We do. I want to check and see on Monday the 22nd. We're scheduled at 2:30. Is it possible to switch to a Tuesday, or does that interfere with work?\n",
            "Patient: The 22nd. Do you have a Friday that week or the week before?\n",
            "Doctor: I do either one Friday the 19th or Friday the 26th.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'll do the 19th. So it's right out.\n",
            "Doctor: My schedule got a little thrown off for that month. So Friday the 19th. I can offer you the 1:30 or 2:30 or 3:30.\n",
            "Patient: Let's see what your 30, let me put this in my calendar.\n",
            "Doctor: We could also meet on Friday the 26th because I am away the week of the 29th to the 2nd, especially since you're feeling bad. It makes sense to have one every week. We can do the same thing the 2:30 on the 26th.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, 2:30 on the 19th. Okay. Those are both saved in my calendar.\n",
            "Doctor: And I will see you next Monday at 2:30 as well. This is your bill.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",

            "Doctor: Please have a seat Meg. Thank you for coming in today your nutritionist referred you. It seems that she and your mother have some concerns. Can you sit down and we will take your blood pressure and do some vitals?\n",
            "Patient: I guess I do need to get back to my dorm to study. I have a track meet coming up also that I'm training for I am a runner.\n",
            "Doctor: How many credits are you taking and how are classes going?\n",
            "Patient: 21 credits. I am at the top of my class. Can we get this done? I need to get back.\n",
            "Doctor: How often and fart do you run for training now? You are 20, correct?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I run 9 miles everyday.\n",
            "Doctor: Your blood pressure is 100 over 50. And your pulse is 52 Meg. How much have you been eating?\n",
            "Patient: I have been eating time. I talked to the nutrition nutritionist about this earlier.\n",
            "Doctor: Let's have you stand up and face me and I will back you onto the scale eyes on me, please. Thank you. And now for a hike, okay, looks like 5 5 go ahead and have a seat.\n",
            "Patient: How much can I please see what the scale says? I'm fat.\n",
            "Doctor: Please set up and I will listen to your heart and lunch.\n",
            "Patient: fine\n",
            "Doctor: You know that this is not a positive part of your treatment we have discussed this before you were here today because your nutritionist and your mom are both very concerned about you. You're very ill make\n",
            "Patient: I am fine. I am eating I tell my mom what I eat just because I'm not fat like she is.\n",
            "Doctor: How have you felt are you feeling sad or depressed last time? We talked you were quite unhappy. Are you feeling suicidal?\n",
            "Patient: I am busy and not concerned about happiness. I need to train and I am tired of everyone asking me about what I eat and how much I exercise and the smartest in my class and one of the best Runners on the team. I don't have time for all this. I'm only here to keep my mom off my back.\n",
            "Doctor: When you were here last you agree to keep working with your nutritionist and being open with your mom and me. We need to work together to help you get. Well, there are regular rhythms in your heart and I've noticed the Downy hair on your back and arms.\n",
            "Patient: I will work with all of you. I know I don't want to be like this. I need to run though. It helps me.\n",
            "Doctor: When you were in treatment, we were working toward some goals with your cognitive behavioral therapy. We need to revisit these goals first though. We need to bring your mom in and have a discussion about the next steps to help you get why I would like to do more tests to check your electrolytes in your blood count.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I do want to be better.\n",

            "Doctor: Hi.\n",
            "Patient: Hi, so James while I was in the hospital as other than sending out like the daily update to family. And so he sent me he like copy me on sort of the last one yesterday and it seemed to me that was only a lot more detailed than the ones in the past. So like stuff about my psychiatrist.\n",
            "Doctor: You certainly like that.\n",
            "Patient: Why?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Things that like an like basically said that I would not have chosen to tell my mom for example or James my little brother like I love them but it's not necessarily even that I don't want them to know but I didn't know that they like I didn't know that when I was having a conversation with James that anything in the conversation fair game, which is pretty much how it panned out. So I really freaking about this like great. I mean I don't it's all right. I just sort of a place in iconic like sort of them. Like I'm freaking out man, and I can never take myself. Seriously when I say that word actually. so I Surprising to me and so I was like what it's just you email me a lot more details that I probably would have wanted or whatever in and like I didn't say anything after that because I didn't really have anything to talk. and I was also like it was like 10 minutes before I was getting into bed. I was checking my emails one last time before I went bad.\n",
            "Doctor: last night\n",
            "Patient: Then I checked email today and James posted like, you know clearly upset and then before I went to bed he was like I'm very upset at the light at the like education that I did something inappropriate by sending these updates. I was like, well, I'm pretty upset that stuff that I was talking about to my psychiatrist appointment in the in the emails and he's like, there's nothing different than the ones he sent in the last hospitalization, which you were fine with I was like, well, it seems like there's a big difference to me saying between Tanya had a rough day today, but it's feeling better towards the evening or like Tanya is doing well. We'll go. it seems like there's a big difference between that sort of email and and then I was like I'm going to bed. It's not I'm not even sure whether I'm upset with him for sending the email like I'm clearly upset with him for being upset with me for having a problem. I feel like that's just the thing more like I'm really scared and scared and I I don't know. I know this is a very kind of interesting thing where I sort of feel like I was against okay shoulders relaxed. Then I'll be like no. No, that's not okay and like again. I don't. I don't know whether I'm like angry about this or just scared or just don't feel good about having like, you know. I don't I don't feel good about having my family like know these things about me and I don't feel good that I wasn't the one who got to tell them about that or got to decide whether they know that I don't feel good, though. like the conversation that I had with James in the last week or so that felt most Sort of intimate and understanding and relaxed and supported you know, and then ending up passing on to other people. That's why I don't feel good. But I'm not allowed to be angry about that like that sucks. So that's what I'm learning. And so when I take the James's mom out, she'll have very much and what would very much are? dryer relationship over 10 years has been like her sort of wanting to be like a mother to me and me sort of like tiptoeing to being able to share things with her and trusting her and a part of this is like she doesn't really understand all of this. It's not that she's really sympathetic, but she doesn't doesn't resonate with her. It doesn't make sense. And so it's in the back of my mind. I'm always like I'm the person who's putting her baby through this horrible ordeal. alien You know and my mom I know we'll will sort of use this to search further like blur the lines between me and her and say I did this. Thing 2, I mean where exactly the same and I just don't want to have that conversation with her and I tell her why I was in the hospital in the first place, you know, I'm glad that James told her that I was in the hospital because I feel like she had a right to know but I don't feel like she had the right to know all of it.\n",
            "Doctor: You know, I imagine you so much of you sort of like you you was afraid but this was going to seem like to her.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know whether like the time I was in Frederick. It feels like sharing the externals of the situation person internal like I was last time. Think I was not internal parts with James either. We doesn't necessarily see a difference, you know, I was doing UCT. So nobody had access to my interior like that including me.\n",
            "Doctor: There wasn't a whole lot of parent Lee.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: At least that we can know about at least that we can know about it.\n",
            "Patient: Lakes Start if you like James upset with me because I wasn't successful in my effort not to react in any way until I could access the best way of approaching the situation was I literally had an involuntary. I've read the email and that and like what is it? What is it? What's wrong and I could not answer then.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Because he knew I was reading that email.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And I feel like that's what's upsetting about.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: or you you know, I didn't say that. I was angry with him. I didn't say I was angry with what he had done. I said I was upset about what happened.\n",
            "Doctor: and even that\n",
            "Patient: And that was yeah, actually I didn't say I was upset about what it happened. I had said that like I would have chosen to share much which was not the same thing at all. I feel like my problem is really bottling up emotions. This isn't going to help very much.\n",
            "Doctor: I felt the same. You must feel like this means you've been right.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's even more particular than that. That the point of keeping people out or away from what's going on, especially like bad things you feel I think I think has been because your anticipated that like that wouldn't give me give them a kind of that would give other people a kind of access to you. That would be very dangerous. That would sort of that they would react to in their own way or from their own frame of reference without taking yours into account in a way. That would be very hurtful to you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, I don't think this is like what you're describing with James. Mom. Your mom and James are also different types of examples of bad, I think. That it might seem clear like that. Yeah, like your mom makes it about her.\n",
            "Patient: I have like a tickle.\n",
            "Doctor: that's okay well they each sort of agendas that feels very destructive or hurtful to you\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. You could. Cy James upset I mean I sort of see it clearly enough that I can't push pass to get to know how I'm upset, but I don't know what to do about.\n",
            "Doctor: well it kind of struck me that there's really no room for both of you to be upset somehow in other words I mean I think this is a very sort of in part of Of in part a construction on on yours or maybe both of yours. I don't know. For which, I mean like it seems to me as though it seems it feels like you can't be both angry and upset about it and scared and partly angry at him. Also recognizing that you know, there's some sort of as yet to be determined is not entirely his fault in the situation in that the situation has sort of changed, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, absolutely.\n",
            "Doctor: And we're at least in your sense of it. He can't be upset that you know, you're mad at him and\n",
            "Patient: imagine that\n",
            "Doctor: he was trying to do something. He thought was helpful at least consciously and and that you're angry and disappointed anyway, and you know where he can feel that way but also kind of see where you're coming from. It sounds like it's way too kind of it's way too kind of jam together.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Does that?\n",
            "Patient: it's like I'm trying very hard to have both of those in my head at once but like I can't one because but we both make sense, but like the one pushes out the other I feel like I can't sort of. you know, I think too hard about like the ways in which it's reasonable for James to be upset and like it's reasonable for him to sort of feel hurt about how I'm giving him a hard time trying to like both take care of me and take care of our family in this way. But if I think too hard about it, then I say well, I'm just a terrible person for being upset in the first place. Yeah, I can't hold it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah, you have a sort of a split.\n",
            "Patient: Which is a strange feeling because the very different from not being able to conceptualize it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: like yeah Thank you for not explaining to me. How both of those can Beach? Sorry, I've been had a lot of people do stuff to me week. Like yeah, no. No, I got it.\n",
            "Doctor: In a way the irony is as far as I can tell like that's why we all have jobs is because of the difference.\n",
            "Patient: So today is Ash Wednesday.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Which I don't know how much you know this but I'm not going to church this evening and they're going to take some ashes and put them put them on our foreheads across and say remember that you're just and unto dust you shall return. It's like one of my favourite Services of in the year Ashley, but what is hard because it's been Vision transitional about repent sinner moment and thinking a lot about Sin.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: And it's virtually impossible for me to do that in a healthy way. Like I just I get swallowed.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, like you're just talking about it in the way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. So, you know. All the times people give up chocolate or something like not eating on Friday. So I decided I was going to stop self injuring myself or stop injuring during lunch. And that's going to be my discipline. I'm not really sure I'm going to make it feels pretty ambitious today.\n",
            "Doctor: And let it goes till Easter.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: witches\n",
            "Patient: It's not really one I can talk about with people people are like what are you giving up for lunch? It's like that's something people actually asked which I don't know. I feel like I'm only now realizing like how glaringly inappropriate that question is. Like they're asking intrusive questions then that would be like a lie.\n",
            "Doctor: then you make your point.\n",
            "Patient: Amelia one of the priests of my visit in\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: I like her a lot. I think she's like really excited like talks about Theology and gets really excited about it. And I do the same thing. It's like if that's really fun, but she also she visited the first time and she visited twice briefly and the first time we were talking and I don't remember what I was saying, but we sort of like talking about the intersection of mental illness in Theology and she was sort of talking about my experience and really got into it and she was like, I'm really sorry like this is your life. I'm like, but it's interesting. Right and she was like he has so That was good. Only the second time she visited we were sort of Jay the same thing and don't remember exactly what she said but like something was like touched in her or very much sort of hit me and I'm like what sort of Corvette and I think that came out either like I said or how it looked I think it's sort of scared her. She reacted really. Well like she sort of just sat with it then like, you know. I told a half way made a joke and those fun I guess like I can't it's hard. It feels sort of hard for me to understand that like people can't see that in me. Like she wouldn't have ever been around me in the contacts. We're like like she would know that's what it's like. I don't know. It might be things since I can't tell whether they're like it's sort of shorthand that I'm sick. Amusing is Ashley expresses what I needed to express I guess. I mean like I talk to her about like being in the hospital before and Mentally ill and having really severe depression trying to describe that. sometimes I'll talk about it and feeling like in the spit or I don't know. And so it doesn't occur to me that people just don't necessarily understand what that means because when I talked about it, I'm just sort of talking about it like this. I don't know. I don't know. You know, I started crying when Mark was there and at the end of the visit he was like, yeah, I've never seen you cry before and you know, he visited me in the hospital before I like, I don't know if that hadn't occurred to me. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I mean, it seems like you're sort of sandwich in between talking about it and conveyed.\n",
            "Patient: Yes. you know in some ways like Ice Hocking about it because I feel like I feel like that helps me sort of get out of my head around it or something power over it, but it also seems to maybe leave out everything essential. or\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I think you have to worry about conveying it one is sort of the word word. That's just come up. I mean in a way it seems like to me that's actually what James did more than you wanted, you know the level of detail, which he was describing. It felt more like he was conveying it in some way.\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so. I think really more out of what was something is there like he was conveying a lot of likes sort of theories about it. And I feel like I mean one of the problems that I ran into with James is that I like him about something that Like I talk about with you or I talked about with somebody else. He's like, maybe this is what's going on and I will just get stuck on it and then I won't be able to say like no, but they're that sort of simple certain way of talking thinking about it or like things are complicated or that's not the way I'm thinking about it and it's just like wood store to be a little bit more. I don't know. I don't\n",
            "Doctor: clearly I Only because it it lines up for me and sort of way that's unending kind of parallel to like, you know, the humanities versus the heart scientist. Like, you know today it's one thing and tomorrow it might be something else. I'm going to revise and update. Where is like, this is how it works. I know that's not.\n",
            "Patient: Is closed anyway? I don't know, but I think I think actually what I'm sort of objecting objecting to I'm not gay don't.\n",
            "Doctor: Sounds to me like like what you're describing is sort of the provisional aspect of what you are saying gets lost.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And so it's kind of like you're held to whatever you said.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: or whatever that idea was\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: in some way that I guess leads to like it's both misunderstanding and a kind of shade.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, but I think that like I'm sort of trying to revise because I think that's like what I'm upset about but it's clearly that if that makes sense like I think you're right. That's some sort of. Something like I don't know. It's like some part of me that I would not necessarily have chosen to give to people. I'm sorry. I think I interrupted you.\n",
            "Doctor: That's all right, if my what I was going to say what I was going to say that I think for you, there are two dangers in that one, which is what happened, which is that people use that according to their own agendas in ways that are very hurtful and the others that that becomes your agenda which really hurts somebody else.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. so if this off. I would I want to share it with anybody, but I think\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, it doesn't seem like you seem to sort of feel a bit more anxious and upset and a little pressure. Even when you came in knowing that you were going to tell me about what just happened and I think in a way relieve that or less fear than you often are that what you were saying was going to either, you know, hurt me or that I was going to respond in a way that was kind of using it in some way to hurt you. I mean, you're still probably worried about those things.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I don't feel like it.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh good. You think you'll ask your mom about that?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think that but I'm worried going forward because I can't tell James things like I can't Mike figure. I just don't you know that I'm going to be there. I'm like, yeah, it's always there but no I have to pay attention to it. I don't know what I'm going to do. Probably just not think about it or anything. I shouldn't read through all the emails. I think I read the first couple and then I just don't really know that it's necessary or at least right now. I can't deal with it anything else.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I think James is really was really angry not like about this, but about my being in the hospital.\n",
            "Doctor: Which means I think that that either he maybe was right. I mean because I too also wonder if you are. I don't entirely well, I wonder about the extent to which you feel like you've done something terribly wrong or you deserve sort of Mabry like really angry or punishing because you will allow yourself to be really taken care of. And to kind of like I don't know. I think you were still wanting to be taken care of in a way that you usually can't or don't and it could also and it could also both be true.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. No, I mean I think for me saying is that probably true. I am not sure whether it would have come up if I had a sort of seeing James now like after I came out James was the stress of it. for him\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, I guess when you say that I think of what more of my concern is, like when he conveys that he's angry and it seems like part of the problem is you feel a part of you that of course, even though you should be\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. No, yeah, that seems so obvious to me that it only just occurred to me that you were questioning that.\n",
            "Doctor: right We should stop now.\n",
            "Patient: Sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: What's up, it's nice out.\n",
            "Patient: I was just walking around. I was just thinking about sorry. I hope it doesn't bother you when I crack. Sometimes people get. I was just thinking about how you were saying or you said a number of times. It's no longer about on any particular week or month or whatever whether I'm depressed or whether I'm feeling anxious or better today. I was really thinking about that. I was really kind of sitting with that feeling and it's absolutely true. I was like wow, that's why I feel kind of wacky because when I just stopped and I just kind of scan how I feel I don't feel good or bad. I'm just I just am know what I mean. And I think that's it's odd. Yes, and I'm feeling for me. I noticed a little thing. That was when I stopped at the cafe. This girl came in it was super pretty and I thought I remember how I told you before if I see someone super pretty whoever who especially if they seemed like they were kind of my type or whatever. That can instead of just beat me like, oh, wow. Look at that beautiful girl. I can be like a whole like I just feel down and you know what, I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I noticed on now that doesn't that just doesn't happen or even if it does happen is not part of me. You know what I mean? It just pops up and it just kind of sits like she got her coffee. Smiley smiley. We smiled at each other as she left and I was like, all right, you know what? I mean? I noticed that so there's that thing if I won't go down that road I can so it's just an interesting how it's\n",
            "Doctor: It's less and less ego-syntonic. It's less that.\n",
            "Patient: Wes unless what?\n",
            "Doctor: Ego-syntonic is a word we use for certos. It's totally consistent with your sense of yourself and encompasses your whole sense of yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Wait a second. What's the difference between that and egocentric?\n",
            "Doctor: That's not what I mean. There's a very big difference. So ego-syntonic means something that just feels like you\n",
            "Patient: So it's a good thing or\n",
            "Doctor: it's just consistency with your sense of yourself.\n",
            "Patient: I see.\n",
            "Doctor: As opposed to Ego distant distant onyc feels that it's something alien to yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Take some notes fact. That's an amazing word.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a different balance than egocentric. It doesn't have anything to do with being self-centered self-centered or ego-syntonic s y n\n",
            "Patient: OS\n",
            "Doctor: and ego diss ego-dystonic\n",
            "Patient: Huh? Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: so it's like being its walls in line and fits right in with yourself with your sense of yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Got it, whatever in a might be.\n",
            "Doctor: Verses if you started hallucinating you might feel like wait, what's happening to me? This isn't me? This isn't actually happen to me.\n",
            "Patient: Got it. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like it's starting to separate a little bit these kinds of experiences from feeling like they're just totally you. This is how you think this is what?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It becomes something a flash of something you can recognize but there's some separated Miss from it.\n",
            "Patient: and I'm still so this is what\n",
            "Doctor: Feeling more and more ego-dystonic. It's not it's no longer taking away your sense of self.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, he got it. So these things that what I just talked about that, okay, so that's ego-dystonic\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, and it's moving in that direction where it's a thought that appears or a sense o I could have had those feelings but\n",
            "Patient: But it's not really who I am. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Not really who you are that's connected to your mother's voice or your the sense of all these old feelings.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Those are like the voices and thoughts has more of your environment. And your context that don't really have anything to do with you with who you your sense of who you are got it. That's awesome. Okay. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry for the big word it started.\n",
            "Patient: No, I want to know what those words. That's awesome. Yeah, because even I was walking around and it's not that I don't feel Melancholy. Yeah, because I think I do like yeah, why am I? Why? Have I been able to accomplish a lot of other things but I can't and haven't why haven't I chose? Why haven't I had one relationship that I can get that I can point to and say yeah, that was exactly the kind of girl. I wanted or very close to the kind of girl I wanted. And she lived around here and you know what? I mean, and it was just all just nice. We just dated even if it doesn't work out we did and it was nice and she was my girlfriend. You know what I mean? I don't get that about that's that is a mystery to me still. I mean I get what some of the factors might be. But I guess what I'm saying though is even when that kind of bums. We out I'm walking around I feel melancholic about it, but I don't yet doesn't change the consistency of my days. You know what I mean? How old I am daily, you know what I mean, which is amazing, but I can also see how that's kind of unsettling because then I have all the space in my mind.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah that used to take up so much energy in space and\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I've I was just reading I always go back to this Julia kristeva book about have you read this?\n",
            "Doctor: which one?\n",
            "Patient: depression and melancholy\n",
            "Doctor: I read parts of it not the whole book.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, but anyway, anyhow, she's French so half the time who the fuck knows what she saying, but I don't I did notice that though. I was reading some sentences and I do have trouble. I still have trouble kind of concentrating or focusing in the moment. But less so so there were some sentences where I was like, oh, I think I know exactly what the sentence is what the sentence means that's a good thing instead of just reading it and being like wait. What? What did I just read? I don't know what I'm reading. Is getting a little better with stuff like this. That before I beat you like I just have no idea what's going on here. I don't know what these words are. I don't even get the and I even have moments where I can't follow their grammatical structure of the sentence, which is really disconcerting. Now I don't get upset about that and just like I just I'm like fine just keep going don't stop and get all stressed about what that and then eventually I picked up once and then I really get it.\n",
            "Doctor: because also are took you're talking about reading some pretty heavy-handed authors who a lot of people who a lot of people don't I mean people spend entire careers trying\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's true. But you know how it is if you're both an artist and you've also been in school and then Grad school and then I mean, you know how people talk about the shit is if they some of them are Faking It.\n",
            "Doctor: crosstalk\n",
            "Patient: Right now I'm with you but still if you're someone that's like me that's really intimidating. Then it makes you feel shity that you don't how come you can't talk about things like that or even if they're pretending why am I not able to read that or and then just pretend some sort of pretend. I'm very intimidating articulation about that or something. You know what? I mean? I'm just not it's not in me that's once into is I just I mean then there are people who do have substantive. Things to say about stuff that they read and I think I'm in that camp and it just bothers me or it has bothered meme. When I just feel like I'm glazing over. Because I know that some of that is definitely yeah, you're totally right. Who knows what the hell they're talking about, but some of that also, I think it is just my situation. When there so much static constantly just your being aroused by negative thoughts and this worries and whatever even reading Danielle Steel would probably be dead. Probably forget the paragraph. I just read there is a lot of that sometime sometimes I do get what I'm reading.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, crosstalk best different.\n",
            "Patient: yeah but I'm just forgetting immediately I can't retain information so that's gotten better but\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, now it's sort of moving towards where there's more freedom to say. Okay, I didn't get those sentences and not be so critical of yourself.\n",
            "Patient: yeah I know I don't care so much like this book I don't care what I'm reading it I slept through it I just read different chapters and go back to beginning and their read that again who cares it was passed I was just very dogmatic and hard myself. That shit like no you pick it up and you read and you make notes and\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like I feel. I was really hard on myself. But again, it's because I projected I assumed I imagine that there are other people who get these things and they make little notes. What are these notes that they're making? What's the what are the insights are happening when they read things and yeah, it was really\n",
            "Doctor: Other people because I hear your notes all the time about the things you're reading you have notes.\n",
            "Patient: write that again.\n",
            "Doctor: I know whether you're writing them in the margin margin or not, but you have things you're thinking.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but you know what? I mean, it's like with everything else written music just sent projection that I always have some even though why\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah other people somehow.\n",
            "Patient: are doing it better or they're more together or they're the real thing or is there something I don't know what how to describe it. But yeah, I have a great band and I'm a good songwriter, but somehow I'm not cool enough or I'm not whatever that thing is that I'm perceiving that other people have But now I know it's just exactly that. It's just what I'm projecting or thinking that I perceive it just another way to kind of put yourself down or just think you're last in other people. So yeah now that it it don't feel That is my just much easier. Now. I just pick up a book and who gives a shit. I just want to read a couple pages of us and I'm done. I don't have to write a paper about it. So.\n",
            "Doctor: Or if you want to read more because you want to read more you'll read more.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: But not feeling like you have to in order to feel good about yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Are they even if I read it from cover to cover or not caring whether I have made your insights about whether I get everything she's talking about or so, but yeah, I think just in general. That's the bag. Yeah, I really kind of yeah. Today, I was just sort of walking around just kind of feeling the feeling of not having extreme feelings. It was just interesting\n",
            "Doctor: Feeling the feelings of not being manic or depressed in a way having an ordinary emotional life, which is which has feelings are going to be feeling good bad. Ugly. I mean, they're all there in ordinary people but they're not it's not just waiting for this. Terrible Darkness all the time being on top of the world. It's not it just hasn't been like one of those. I think that's you're saying it's really disorienting.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, just yeah, it's very yeah, it's just so new. It's like I don't ya I guess it's it is disorienting.\n",
            "Doctor: I also think in another piece you're talking about as we were talking about all these authors and philosophers and to your additions that it's starting is what if these aren't the other who have all the right answers.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Because I think that's been a comfort for you to sort of the people who know what they're talking about and who are really smart and write a lot and our sounds like they know what they're talking about. And it also has a way of feeling bad about yourself that there's this whole body of people like that and what if what if they have some things to contribute but what if you disagree with some what if what if you think they're wrong or\n",
            "Patient: Right. What if they're just regular at the end of the day? They're just people.\n",
            "Doctor: Right of you that were entrenched in their own histories or their own time there that's kind of disorienting to because there's no one on the pedestal anymore.\n",
            "Patient: Right. That's true.\n",
            "Doctor: You could be reading something and start saying what a crock of shit or she doesn't know what she's talking about.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well, I think that a lot of times when I read this and like it's just this typical French. I think there's something there but I bet you could say it in 10 pages. Yeah, but I mean at the end of the day all the stuff is now it's about time doing something constructive with you know what I mean? I think that's the next step is be more productive day in and day out because I'm still not but it's much better but I mean, that's why I'm really glad I did this. I feel really nervous about the business. But see now. I was just washing my hands down. I said only just remembered. Oh, I have an offer and The good thing now, it's fucking real. You know what? I mean? I can't be talking about. Yeah, I wonder how I'm going to Market going to Market to it doesn't matter. It's just got to get done. I need to figure things out. Embassy them and do them and so that's a good feeling. That's a really good feeling and if nothing else I'll have those box of time in a beautiful office to gather my thoughts and write or read or study for being a life coach or doing my maybe whatever. I don't know. I was like maybe I should just take ice just start taking you some psychology courses anyway. I mean I could just go to UMass or whatever and just take some courses are online. It's so easy now. But anyway that are is this. Things are getting a little more. I'm forcing things to get more structured and you know what, I mean? But that's a big part of it too. When you have time to be scanning how you feel and think all the time that's not good.\n",
            "Doctor: Everybody gets cranky.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, exactly. So you need some kind of I mean, I want the flexibility. I want whatever whatever. But the reason I want all this. I want all that is so I can have the kind of structure. I want it's not that I don't want structure work, you know, you know what I mean? But so now it's time to an act that put things together put that together.\n",
            "Doctor: When is your first day at the office?\n",
            "Patient: Monday\n",
            "Doctor: Monday I didn't know if it started September 1st or October 1st, or\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I guess it could you know, I mean I guess I could have just used yesterday. I haven't Mondays and Wednesdays 12 to 4. But yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So you could have used it Wednesday.\n",
            "Patient: I could have used it Wednesday. I'm pretty sure yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Not yesterday.\n",
            "Patient: Wait, what?\n",
            "Doctor: crosstalk\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, Wednesday, right? Today's Friday. Sorry. Yeah, I suppose I could have yeah, but yeah, so Monday I'll just go and start kind of figuring out what it's like what the deal is and\n",
            "Doctor: Do you have set hours assume their blocks? Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: They do it by blocks 12 to 4 Mondays and Wednesdays.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Which is why I had to move fast. They had other I mean, I think that's a pretty good. It seems to be a lot of time that people want.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I had a feeling no one wants to see life coach at 9 a.m. Or I mean, I don't know. I think later in the days. I mean I still worry a little bit. I don't let people what about everybody that's working 9 to 5 or whatever. Things like that, whatever but whatever me and obviously I'm here people are here seeing therapist or whatever. So but yeah, and then I wonder where I don't know if there's flexibility with that once you get going or I don't know. I don't know how that works, but\n",
            "Doctor: ask\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean if I had some clients. Where they were like I can I really can only come at this time at that point. I had to figure out what the deal is but\n",
            "Doctor: So will interfere with our Wednesday time then 12 to 4.\n",
            "Patient: Not right now, but yeah at some point if it did then because right now it's all open so I could just tell someone to come at 2 or 3 or 4 or whatever. But oh, that's the other thing. I don't know just woke before mean the last client like you need to be out by 4.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, because it's a 4-Hour block. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: It does right for our block. Okay, that's what I thought.\n",
            "Doctor: So you have a 12 1 2 and 3.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Okay. Ohyeah. That's interesting. So wait. 12 to 1 1 2 2 and o no you can still see. Our people but chances are you know, I mean, I'd have to have people conflicting. I mean, I don't have that problem at some point. But yeah, that's I mean, I'm a dumbass about take advantage. You know what I mean? if I'm not there at least writing reading working out of business, you know what I mean? That could be my time to just see even that instead of constantly if you don't have something structured and you can always be thinking about it or not. That's why I'm like, alright well until I have the clients. Those hours are for business marketing Network email people. I don't know whatever.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's why I raised our appointment time because that's already going to interfere. Will you go there for an hour and then come back here and then go back?\n",
            "Patient: Probably. Yeah, I mean it's right here.\n",
            "Doctor: It is an hour of your time that you're paid for.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's well, that's okay. I mean, that's okay for now. It's but yeah, I mean, yeah, it's it gives me that are even with the writing. You know what I mean? Okay, I'm going to work on a business little bit. Then I'm going to Thursday's no excuse now, you know what? I mean? It's a beautiful place peace and quiet nice Sunday Byron place is on me now. So I think that So I think that's I could tell I needed something like that to kind of. You need a good kind of pressure.\n",
            "Doctor: So what will stop so what will stop you now come Monday. Do you think you'll be there?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think anything. No, I mean I'll be looking forward to it. Yeah, you didn't go Wednesday and wondered why? Well, Wednesday was a day I get bleach them.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like I could be kind of weird like your Solis. I'm going upstairs. So yeah. Definitely has to figure out the marketing thing. So no, it's you can't just be sending out emails hoping to get clients or whatever. I got to figure out a way to be more specific kind of marketing. I was just thinking about Cecilia. and I was thinking today was kind of chilly in the morning even little things like when I wake up. She has a habit of at least every other day when I wake up. I feel her I mean is just ridiculously cute. I sleep on my side. And I will literally kill her crunched up and mashed in as part of me like this. It's like we're expanding. And I was thinking about that. I was like that. even though is I almost don't know what to Do with it. If so every time it happens I can't today was. and she also kind of took some up some of the blanket so I was pretty cold and I was not but I didn't want to I don't want to scare her away or get her off to ped. Sorry, just laying there but even stuff like that is I'm just not used to it still.\n",
            "Doctor: What's the feeling what's it like?\n",
            "Patient: It's just beautiful. It's like now I get it animals are you're not really human until you can you can connect with a pet. It's just unconditional love and it's so peaceful and sweet. It's just an amazing thing.\n",
            "Doctor: And say I mean she feels so safe with you to be able to nozzle her way in and curl up wherever she wants to and take up whatever space she wants to and know that it's okay.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Yeah, it's very sweet yet. And then when she does get out, she'll come up and she'll just They just know not to scratch you or so. She just puts her paw. So just go like this ER. She doesn't know my head or is she looks a pillow right next to me is that's just crazy. It's such a beautiful thing. She somehow knows. Okay, I'm not going to use my class for this one. It's so amazing.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, she's attached. I mean, she's feeling she's feeling loving affection. She's not wanting to attack is not even in the realm of\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean ragdolls are like that anyway, but then When they do get attached to their owners, I think it's more like they're just very affectionate. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: so affectionate\n",
            "Patient: I mean it's crazy. But now I can see I'm a crazy need Riser here. Especially someone like that. He's a lunatic now I get why his cat is his best friend. I mean because he's so fucked up but it's I'm not comparing me but I see why people who don't have friends you don't have inside but at least there's comfort in about a creature with you depends on you and who\n",
            "Doctor: well around him you feel safe to if he's up vulnerable or has that many defenses up or there's so much stuff protecting going on because he's been so hurt somewhere or\n",
            "Patient: That's right. Yeah, I exactly\n",
            "Doctor: you know, you're safe with an animal.\n",
            "Patient: It's interesting. I was thinking about we have a show coming up and it's a good bill, but I think because of the way I've been feeling. I almost don't care that much. It's a weird feeling. It's not that I'm looking forward that I'm not looking forward to it. It's just kind of I don't find myself kind of way used to I care about making music releasing whatever but I just don't care. About the shows as much I guess. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: It's connected the feeling you're having wandering around. What is this in between?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's not extreme. Yeah, not like I don't know ya.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not terrified of it.\n",
            "Patient: No, not at all.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not elated about anything about it happening.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. Yeah, right. It's just kind of like oh, yeah, we're going to play the show. I almost don't know how I'm supposed to feel you know what I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe that's why I had a weird what seems like a panic attack at the outdoor show. It was just kind of like I feel confident. I'm fine and yet I feel weird like maybe I'm not used to the way I'm feeling I don't know what the fuck it was but everything was right on everything sound right everything. I don't know. Maybe that's why I guess maybe I was anxious because I wasn't anxious or something. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What can you send me more about what what it was feeling like just before you came in here because you were wandering around.\n",
            "Patient: what I felt\n",
            "Doctor: You're thinking about this feeling that it's it's neither extreme.\n",
            "Patient: it felt nice. I mean just the weather is nice. I was just and I was just aware of the fact that I was fine. That was basically I was like, it's a beautiful day. I'm fine. I can't think of anything. That's really I'm not depressed whatever but I also don't feel amazing. You know what I mean? Or I pick something like I do feel really lonely, but somehow it's not It's just their I'm not it's not affecting me and some. It's not stopping me from also feeling pretty good. You know what I mean? So yeah, I was just kind of like\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder I guess how that then so then you come in here. Does that also throw you off here? What do we talk about them?\n",
            "Patient: I get a little more anxious care. Yeah because of I\n",
            "Doctor: Because I can imagine that if you're feeling depressed, you know what to talk about.\n",
            "Patient: right. Yeah, I do not anxious. But yeah, I do feel more a little more jittery or like I'm not sure. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Or like almost what else is in there, then what's going to be there? If it's not some extreme this or that were clinically significant something. Who are you?\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. Yeah. Am I going to be repeating myself or I don't know. Yeah, not repeating. But you know what, I mean. Just picking seems like I'm only or what or am I just going to be talking about how to grow the business or you know what? I mean? I yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Unless maybe exactly it in a way though. Seems lead to deeper. feeling sexual\n",
            "Doctor: In a way or tuck these things you're saying is there's something then you get to start to know about what comes up inside of you isn't some extreme problem going on that's very easy to identify and talk about is not trusting yourself not trusting that what will come up. We'll come up even if it's a surface thing. That is the first thing that occurs to you that it comes up for a reason it connects to other things and nothing comes out of nowhere and everything has a meeting there's not You're not trusting of just trusting of your mind. So you get to relax and just\n",
            "Patient: I think it's partly about yeah, but it's partly. I may be more. That I just when you're so used to extremes it's almost like I don't even know what I'm thinking about anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: I yeah, I guess I feel lonely. But yeah, I don't know, you know what I mean? So that's why I'm saying maybe that is for at least maybe to be like yeah, I'm not sure if I feel that lonely right now, but let's talk about loneliness. You know what I mean? Because then that does lead to and I think that's kind of the whole point now coming here.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: What about today? I feel like shit or yesterday is someone looked at me funny or whatever the fuck I feel or I feel amazing. They're not these extreme things that have to be worked out or whatever. They're just now. It's a much more. I don't know. It's a much more nuanced kind of thing.\n",
            "Doctor: Now we really get to know you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, right.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is really different than knowing your problems.\n",
            "Patient: Right exactly.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's partly what you're saying. You're still getting used to the problems. What's going to be there?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean it's all in either problems or inflated kind of euphoric kind of stuff. You know what I mean? So but yeah mostly problems, so where\n",
            "Doctor: I'm leaving including that in problem as something that's not as grounded in reality trying to sort out who you really are.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, right. It's not grounded. Yeah, it's not stable.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: If nothing else I've just been used to really high state of anxiety all the time. Get her bad now. It's like yeah last week the last few weeks now I feel I think that I did. Do I did this? I feel Whatever anxiety I feel now is anchored to something. It's like well, yeah, I know shit. I mean I just signed at least. So now it's about work in that kind of wears before last week. I felt abstract and more Amor existential anxiety of I'm doing what am I doing? I think it's when you anchor things into either released or whatever a job or whatever it is and you can feel anxious but there's comfort in the fact that there's a concrete thing that you're thinking about. What's my point? But yeah. But in general, yeah, I just I just don't feel the same level of bond stop anxiety all the time. So yeah, it's just kind of it's like emotional Superstar me and fucked up and that's just the way that your stew and then suddenly if it's calm and there's beautiful sunlight and you're like, holy shit like at all the stuff in the water, you know what I mean? Have a good one. I'm going to write that down. Suddenly. You're like there's a whole world in the water. Forget what's going on up here. So that's\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's so different than trying to survive this the storm. It's so different.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. Yeah survive or thinking that well, this is just it this is just the weather. It's not a storm. It's just so it's a perfect metaphor. That's the one it's even better than the Makoma one. Because then it's like not only star world into the water. But even though it's beautiful thing. You're still kind of scared you might fall in. You know what I mean? You're like shit. I don't know if I'm that good that good of a swimmer or what if some of the stuff down there certain things look beautiful, but they're really not or what are some of them look awful, but they're not they're just all different creatures are just all different things.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's a metaphor for all the fears about the couch to what comes out. There was underneath underneath if you go into the deeper layers, what will I like? What will I not like Are you afraid you'll find?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's weird. Sometimes I sit here and there is nothing that really comes up. It's strange or maybe there are but I can't what's the word? I can't my mind doesn't latch onto anything. I'm just kind of I don't know just it's weird. It's so strange and it's emotionally neutral or something.\n",
            "Doctor: It's funny because I was just having a fantasy of helping you into the water, but giving you a life preserver, so I could see you just float around for a while.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: Just know you're not going to drown.\n",
            "Patient: Those things that gives kids on their arms.\n",
            "Doctor: You can look around floaties. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yep, that's awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: You'd be safe wait until you start.\n",
            "Patient: my little goggles\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you could start that way what you can see from the top.\n",
            "Patient: Yep.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm a scuba diver, so I know what it's like.\n",
            "Patient: who is\n",
            "Doctor: I am\n",
            "Patient: are you serious?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's quite the metaphor for going out into the ocean. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Well, no kidding. It's funny because I wonder if subconsciously because that's one thing I have I have I love watching documentaries and stuff. But yeah, something feels really claustrophobic to me about that.\n",
            "Doctor: Going that deep. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But even the pressure that builds and I don't know if there's something about that that's very claustrophobic. But now I wonder if subconsciously it's also about what I was saying. Yeah what we were talking about.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, what?\n",
            "Patient: That's funny your scoobert. You're a scuba. You're like a little josquin stole. That's awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah on the side.\n",
            "Patient: What's that?\n",
            "Doctor: On the side not all the time. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: O on the side, of course, that's awesome. Yeah, I guess when you think about it, it's not. I mean, what's the fear really? It's your oxygen tank. You're down there with the critters, and I don't know but\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it is such a metaphor. I mean people have care of that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think that yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What is meant to be?\n",
            "Patient: yeah, for other people it's like it's being confined in a small space or whatever. But yeah for me it's those two extremes either being really high up or being way below. I mean I can go to the top of a building, but I don't really want to go to the edge or I get freaked out of people get to close. I don't get freaked out. But internally I start getting really nervous when people get too close to Edge the last interesting.\n",
            "Doctor: so floaties\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: I can leave you some floaties on the couch.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, exactly. I'll just go to the store and get those slippers and stuff get the ones that have dinosaurs on them and stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: It's actually not that different unless you wanted to be when you go there and your mind to just as getting in the water.\n",
            "Patient: What's up?\n",
            "Doctor: But the floaties it's not that different than standing on the side of the shore.\n",
            "Patient: Oh you mean\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: oh, no, I yeah, I know that one of those things were until actually I know that was a big difference but\n",
            "Doctor: but I mostly I think it feels like\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, it's emotional. It's I know that I feel really self-conscious.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh. of\n",
            "Patient: Just said I'm one of those dudes that plays on the it would take me a while to now I'm one of those not that it's that's a bad thing. But I've had so much skepticism over the years. I don't know. or things are such a pitch sometimes but yeah, I it's just all the all these little things. I mean a lot of it is just superficial. All of it. I think is just superficial for the most part but\n",
            "Doctor: sexy and I know it doesn't sound superficial.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, no, I mean my excuses or superficial.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I think ultimately it's just I don't know what I would say or how it's going to feel or Or what if somehow changes our drink our dynamic or something? I don't know why it would but\n",
            "Doctor: In some ways you're afraid of is there something you're afraid? What is there something you're afraid? What happened?\n",
            "Patient: It says yeah. It's like I'm afraid if it feels right don't fuk with it. You know what I mean? It took so long to get to this point. I'm just kind of like oh, this is nice. So\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you can stand on the side of a boat for the rest of your life looking in and never taking off because it feels for perfectly fine on the side of the boat.\n",
            "Patient: I know right exactly yet.\n",
            "Doctor: And then you never get to see.\n",
            "Patient: That's true.\n",
            "Doctor: It's actually beautiful. but all the fears of what if it isn't and\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I guess now that I'm thinking about it. It's extreme. For example, I just I just now for some reason I just now saw it. What if I was on the couch one day? What is that? It's not like I have to come in and pee on the couch every day. I mean I could just come and be like, you know what I don't feel like it today. I just want to sit with.\n",
            "Doctor: totally\n",
            "Patient: It's weird. I hadn't really thought about you know what I mean, I think of these.\n",
            "Doctor: as though it's on permanent permanent thing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think of these things are so something. I don't know what I think of it as but yeah, I just like diving I mean you dive and then you come back up. You don't maybe you don't want to die tomorrow. Whatever it is. I mean\n",
            "Doctor: Or you start with snorkeling?\n",
            "Patient: is Cyrus circling?\n",
            "Doctor: That's what you do for a few years and then you get more interested in what's even beneath where you can see on top.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I just look at the top and tropical fish for a while.\n",
            "Doctor: well\n",
            "Patient: Alright. Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: See you Wednesday.\n",
            "Patient: I've been weekend.\n",

            "Patient: See you next week.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, I'm one of the psychiatrists who work here in the department of psychological medicine and I'm seeing you today because you were referred up for the emergency room. I understand that you were brought in by ambulance last night after you're cutting your arms and overdosing on Tylenol. It looks like you are bandaged up. Are you feeling suicidal today?\n",
            "Patient: I never was I need to get out of here. I need to see Carl.\n",
            "Doctor: Is Carl your boyfriend?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: How long have you been together?\n",
            "Patient: Couple of months we've been living together for the last four and a half weeks. Why do you care? Nobody cares? Oh God, I can't believe he is gone. I hate him. I need him to come back because I love him Jack The Jerk was before him feel left me to they all leave. Everybody leaves me. I hate them Carl was David different. He said he loved me. Oh, well, if you loved me you would be here now.\n",
            "Doctor: Call made the 911 call for the ambulance according to your file. You've attempted suicide before this was your first attempt.\n",
            "Patient: I've been it I've been in to have my arm stitched up and my stomach pumped a few times. Nobody cares. I wish someone would help me. Maybe you're the one.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm here to help you. Can you tell me about your past medical history your family history?\n",
            "Patient: I have four kids. Oh my God. Where's my baby? Where is she?\n",
            "Doctor: Your baby was removed and taken to foster care after the ambulance responded to your home last night. Can you tell me about the three other children?\n",
            "Patient: They took them for me. Nobody cares who the hell do they think they are? I hate you. All. My kids need me. I wish Carl would come and get me from this place. Oh screw him.\n",
            "Doctor: What about your family? Can I help with the kids?\n",
            "Patient: Mom died when I was 4 and dad is a drunk. So no good SOB. What did they care? They hate me and would never help me. They've never help me.\n",
            "Doctor: Your chart states that you have been on Depakote and Geodon and Abilify. Can you tell me about these medications? Did they seem to help at all?\n",
            "Patient: Well, if you read the file, you will see that they suck and didn't work. I thought you were going to help me.\n",
            "Doctor: What about therapy? Did you find dialectical behavioral therapy to be beneficial with your therapist?\n",
            "Patient: No, I can't I can't get to the appointments all the time. I told him that it was tough for me to get there all the time and he was no help asshole. I hate him. He was going to help me to I need to get back to my room. I love to watch my TV. You know, I have my favorites that I never like to miss.\n",
            "Doctor: You find some joy in your life then with the fan favorite TV programs.\n",
            "Patient: I never said I didn't I enjoy things of course. I'm not crazy.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you have any drugs or alcohol in your system last night before the overdose?\n",
            "Patient: You're the one with the chart know, I don't drink like my dad. I might binge eat and spend but I don't drink or do drugs.\n",
            "Doctor: Healthy eating and spending binges cause a problem with work or your relationship with Carl or your children.\n",
            "Patient: Sometimes I wish you could help me get my kids my poor baby girl. Could you call Carl for me and see if he could come up here? Carl gets pissed about me spending too much. He was mad last night. It's not my fault. I bought bought stuff for the house and in him to I don't have a job right now. Fired from my last one. They hated me.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm here to help you get there be a medication and then we will work on getting in touch with your family.\n",
            "Patient: I don't have good results with the meds and the therapist is a jerk. Maybe you could be my new therapist. You could be the one to help me.\n",
            "Doctor: I will work in conjunction with your therapist and positions to help your treatment get started. Can you spell the word spread backwards for me?\n",
            "Patient: T i n o r f e l o h s s a how's this going to help? Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: This is the formal status exam that you have had before now. I'm going to say three words and ask you them to ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Okay, the words are horse basketball and car. Do you feel do you often feel suicidal? And can you recall what exactly triggered the attempt last night?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not suicidal. Sometimes I cut myself to feel the pain and release it in the past I cut too deep but got stitched up.\n",
            "Doctor: Would you be willing to see the therapist again and try the dialectical behavior therapy and a new medication? This is the help I can offer you today.\n",
            "Patient: I knew you would help me. I will do therapy and a different medication.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you now. Can you remember those three words?\n",
            "Patient: horse basketball and car\n",
            "Doctor: Good. Thank you. Now. Let's move over to the lab and check your blood work and run some tests before we begin your new medication lead the way.\n",
            "Patient: Sure, let's go dock then. Maybe Carl will come back and watch TV with me and take me home.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Well, what's happening?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know where to begin. So probably best place is present moment, which is just trying to figure out where I'm at present moment wise, which is probably going to the course or the session where I'm at. This morning is Lieutenant Dane strapped to the mass of the boat raging Against The Storm.\n",
            "Doctor: Why?\n",
            "Patient: That's where I'm at.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a good thing that I get the movie reference because whenever I find whenever I use movie reference in classes, all of mine are from the 90s and the 80s. So that's pretty I got that one. That's my jonra.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, it's like there is nothing more Robin Lieutenant Dame Sans screaming at the storm. So yes, and I'm remembering a sentence from a few sessions back. How would I know you're angry? Well, I'm not sure that I'm in this place physically showing it but it's possible.\n",
            "Doctor: I can see it what's been happening?\n",
            "Patient: Why don't you take me if you can can you take me back to where we lost our last session?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, we were talking a lot. I mean you kind of surprisingly told me that you had a discussion with your wife and you talked a bit about being unhappy and she acknowledged that but then it was kind of dropped. I also remember that she had an opportunity to continue the conversation when you went to go see your kid at Indiana University, right and she chose drive with a friend instead. And so I think that's where we were.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, okay. Yes, so that weekend that weekend. I went to see the kids so I had an opportunity to see my son Harry in. Monroe and he had a conference. I stayed over with him lovely lovely evening went out to dinner or went out to breakfast went to out to dinner when my daughter came over. So we had I had an opportunity to connect with all of the kids.\n",
            "Doctor: And was it just you?\n",
            "Patient: It was just me because my wife at the conference with her friends and then we all we all converged at Indiana University Sunday afternoon. My son was in a show. I didn't know the show the show was A Little Night Music.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I'm not familiar and I'm a musical. I love musicals.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, me too. And I said there's a Stephens hold that I've never seen.\n",
            "Doctor: Interesting, okay.\n",
            "Patient: So it's where the song send in the clowns comes from? Okay, and it's all about these love triangles of people in unhappy marriages and Mistress of Mistresses. And there's my son playing me on stage and I said, oh God, this is really the irony here is too thick for me to even sit in.\n",
            "Doctor: Tell me about it.\n",
            "Patient: yes, I don't know if there's much more to tell other than that but hearing send in the clowns will never sound the same again, so it's just like\n",
            "Doctor: It's like a punch to the gut.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yes and then yes, so it's recognizing the lid it's just coming off with the pressure cooker other image that I have is I am I don't know it's terribly unpleasant but just vomiting up emotion and it's the best that I can be is restrained, but I recognize that I've been having these physical reactions. I can feel it. It's like being with the sensations of the body and\n",
            "Doctor: What physical reactions are you having?\n",
            "Patient: Just a lot of tension. I recognize the closer I drive. To going home. It's just this build-up of tension. It's just such a yes. Virtual feeling. So give me a second to try and pull up together, but I'm trying to remember a series of events so that So that was the weekend. I think that I'm just going to throw stuff out there at this point. It feels like no Ruby movie reference, but just a visual of I got these puzzle pieces and I'm throwing them on the table. Like I don't know what so there's a sense of okay. It's not unreasonable to want to have a relationship emotional and physical intimacy. This is crazy. And there's just all this anger just kind of building up and\n",
            "Doctor: It's all the anger. You've been holding back for a long time.\n",
            "Patient: Oh my God decades and it's probably anger that. Create my marriage. I don't know and then yes, I don't know if I can really remember if there were other significant events of that week but the weekend for Christmas this year, we decide knots by guess we ended up buying a season subscription to Broadway on Detroit. So we got tickets and we end up going to the first one of those shows on Sunday night and we ended up going to dinner ahead of time and I was just in this place of kind of of now kind of of this but we're in this public place and it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know that there's something wrong. So she's asking me what's going on and I say recognizing that I am trying to jump back into those old patterns of I'm not saying the words, but they're right there. There's nothing wrong. I'm fine, but I'm not going there. So I'm just sitting with it and there's maybe some awkward silence, but I was finally and again, I'm not going to be able to give the Serbian them or anything like that, but I was able in probably choppy senses and language able to get out expressing all this anger that I am feeling about. And again, I wish I had my recorder so I could have gone back and replayed. What was that we you were really able to say but I know that words probably like the bullet point that you could have used for the 6 News was I was able to say a third person relationship and I'm the odd man out. I did say seven or eight years ago. You called down the flag from the flagship and you transferred it to Lisa's house and you left me here with nothing.\n",
            "Doctor: That's amazing and very powerful.\n",
            "Patient: And so I know that was kind of like where I may or call other things that I was able to stay but for me it was like, okay and the point that I'm trying to I was saying it but there was I don't know remember the sense of being out of control. It was more a sense of there was almost just calm determination. I'm saying this I just kind of learned leaned into it a little bit and it was okay. And as a matter of fact it was like wow.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow is right.\n",
            "Patient: You know the anticipation of saying that was far worse than saying it.\n",
            "Doctor: So what not only enables you to do that, but what enables you to do that and then what reaction did you get?\n",
            "Patient: Wooden table mean I think just the work that we've been doing questioning the canoe sitting with this. I think coming to some kind of resolve but I don't know when that happened but I got to this point and I remember saying it out loud. Damn it. I'm going to have to get intimacy back into my life. And this is not an unreasonable thing for me to want. So I got to do something. I got to take some action to make this happen. I'm recognizing not sitting on my emotions and being dishonest with myself is not going to get me there.\n",
            "Doctor: What reaction did you get?\n",
            "Patient: I think initially there was a sense of being there was some talk about kind of where this is coming from but it's kind of like the process I'm talking about that's true work. I'm doing within individual counseling and stuff like that. There was the sense of like, oh really? So happy for you and you're doing this and it will be not those were the words but the essence was it will be so great when you finally get all fixed and come back and everything will be hunky-dory and it was just that that was like throwing gasoline on the fire and I said,\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, yes sure. That made it much worse. I can see that.\n",
            "Patient: Oh my God.\n",
            "Doctor: yes, well, it's patronizing you go do your job and you just get that fixed with your little counseling program over there, and when you're all fixed come back and we'll go back to The Way We Were\n",
            "Patient: Right and it's just I recognize just that kind of inflamed the torch where the fire and then I also recognized that the other kicker in that was that whenever we talk about intimacy.\n",
            "Doctor: you and she\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it's like we're not talking the same language and she says she's starting to get a little defensive and then the tears are welling up and that kind of thing and she says. All of the things that I do for you to show you how much I care my love and affection for you and all the intimacy that I give you your just not there for that. I said well tell me what that looks like because I believe that's what you're going you're trying to do but I don't know what looks like that and she says well I give you a kiss in the morning on my way out the door when I tell you I love you and it just came out of my mouth and I said, yes, but you know what that looks like to me. It's just a reminder of all the things that I don't have in my life. It's just like well, this was probably not the most sensitive thing to stay in the moment, but it was\n",
            "Doctor: It was deeply honest.\n",
            "Patient: I got a pack on the head and that's it.\n",
            "Doctor: right and Lisa gets the emotional intimacy that you're missing.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and then it was kind of I recognize that. I recognize that was as far as she could go with that moment and she kind of went into this place of and it was almost time for us to move to the show, but then it became mine was conversation about this and that and she was fiddling on the phone and looking at Facebook and telling me about this not I was just like before though I was saying that we were talking about physical intimacy so that conversation then spilled into whatever we were talking about about intimacy is automatic. It's about sexual intimacy. And you said you're not hearing me you're not hearing me and I get it I get her fear of sexual intimacy is so deep that that but she started talking about our sexual intimacy in terms of past tense is incompletely past tense.\n",
            "Doctor: Give me some verbage.\n",
            "Patient: We had a really wonderful sexual intimacy in our life. We have three wonderful kids, not necessarily. She said these words, but it's That's over now and I can't go there anymore. And it's kind of like it's sort of happened at the moment. But the stone that kind of got pushed over there. It took a while before that all started to roll into a Avalanche and it's like wow. Okay, that's been my experience for the last 7 years, but that's never been stated that's never been stated like yeah, it's completely over.\n",
            "Doctor: And how did you react to her sentence?\n",
            "Patient: I have this image that I'm the guy that's been sitting at the rear well station for the last 7 years waiting for the train to show up and I said dude, what a dumbass this train is not even coming back and you're still sitting at the chain at the station.\n",
            "Doctor: You said it the station for some very good reasons?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I get that. But I mean that's where the anger is at in this morning. It was I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Go ahead.\n",
            "Patient: Well, I'm trying to decide if that's the chain of events.\n",
            "Doctor: Even out of sequence. It's okay.\n",
            "Patient: So I get this back that all of this emotion is out there and I know it's not it's got to be scary the living Jesus out of her because I'm programs and it's in a pretty big way and I recognize that may not have been my intent but I don't want to hit the plunger but there you go. I put the nuclear option on the table. And again, where did this conversation fit into it? I'm not 100% sure but I was able to say, you know what I need physical and emotional Intimacy in my life, and I'm no longer willing to live without it.\n",
            "Doctor: Good for you.\n",
            "Patient: And that was a conversation that happened around the kitchen table, maybe yesterday or the day before I'm not sure. I don't know it all started to and I recognized it this emotional Rage or whatever that I'm in right now and I just started puking up junk and I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: Emotional honesty, it's not junk Sheamus.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I know.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not junk. It's a truth that's always been there that she has ignored because it was convenient and you've been trying to ignore so you didn't have to have the conversation. So although I imagine it's a deeply painful space. It's a cathartic space because this is all the stuff that you've been holding it in and it's in some ways. It's unfair that you are the one who has to hold it in and she lives from the benefits of your holding it and you shouldn't have to hold it anymore because you're not asking for anything unreasonable.\n",
            "Patient: Well, I can't I can't and it's coming out and I get that is painful for me and her and everybody else. It's just like\n",
            "Doctor: But it needed to happen.\n",
            "Patient: I'm done at some point. I don't know why but it is just and I have kind of Shut Out music a lot in my life over the past seven years, and I don't know why.\n",
            "Doctor: I know you know why?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I shut down everything.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, not only that but you guys met around music music is white. Sometimes pulls her away from me. Sometimes pulls her away from you. I mean, I\n",
            "Patient: Okay, you know what? Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I mean and so and whenever you are forced to connect it's forced to connect instead of wanting it's around music or her concerts or her deciding what you're going to do so I get it.\n",
            "Patient: The music of course touches emotional cores. So why the hell put yourself there? Whether it's classical music or country music or whatever. I fired up an old Johnny Cash the last Johnny Cash album. He did a cover of Tom Petty. I don't I won't back down and I just like playing that and then it bumps up against his cover of Nine Inch Nails Hurt witches is just so incredibly raw that I'm like, okay. I'm not sure if I can even go here today.\n",
            "Doctor: So you said to her I'm not going to put up with this anymore. And how what did she how did she respond to that?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yes, and again whether this is all out and doesn't matter. I mean, it's how memory works this is why you can ask me 9 different people would happen up a seen the incident and they're going to get nine different explanation. But at some point something well, you know what you're asking me you're asking me to choose go to someplace where I can't go or you're leaving and I didn't all I said where those words and that was her interpretation of that.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you take any of that kind of guilt inducing statement into yourself? Because that's not actually what I'm hearing that you said that maybe what she heard you're stating your own needs and she's received it. Yes.\n",
            "Patient: You know, I think that was the really amazing part of all of this. All I can feel is anger not feeling the guilt.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, good good.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I get that you're hurting and I know that would have done to me in the past and I'm not backing down and I know that there's going to be an onslaught. I mean, this is a fucking fire swamp. I mean this is just going to be this is going to be and I get it. This is, this is the path that you set up a long time ago intentionally or unintentionally. It doesn't make a difference. It's all the damn Domino's that you set up. You can't talk about your feelings. You can't do this. It's 27 years of this. So here's what happened. Here's what happened after 27 years of setting up those Domino's.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, okay, but this is a two-person issue.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I know but I'm going to take responsibility for me.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure, but you're not. Yes and my guess is there were times in the marriage you did try to talk about your feelings and you were shut down and maybe her as well. That's usually what happened. Somebody teaches you how receptive they are to what you think and feel but you're not able to do that anymore and you're not asking anything unreasonable. What is a call and emotional intimacy? That's one of the reasons why people get married and have romantic relationships in the first place those two things. So this isn't anything that's unreasonable. It's a game-changer right? Because you're married kind of in name only and she's okay with that because she's getting her emotional needs met elsewhere, but you're not okay with it anymore. I mean, I'm very proud of you, even though I recognize that it said deeply painful experience, but it almost needed to happen because you're not good at being honest with you.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not good at being honest with me.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not good at being honest with you you can do it, but\n",
            "Patient: I think I've been doing it for a long time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, but it's taken its toll. Yes and what you're asking the complement that's missed is I want to be close to you. That's not what she heard but in some ways.\n",
            "Patient: But I don't guess you know what? I don't think that's there.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I and I hear what you're saying, but the idea that I want intimacy and this is your expectation. I don't know if you guys can do that or have that given all the damage that's been done. I don't know what that you can't have it but I don't know and I don't know if that's what you're seeking from her but stating that expectation there still an inherent complement and it is this is what I've been looking for. This is what I need.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and if anything, the only thing that I can hold onto right now is that I can say that to me I can say that to me. It's okay say another event had happen is Insurance some of this with a friend there was this image that came back to me in some work that I had done a long time ago in the terms of like the inner child kind of thing. And this is back when I was doing my masters in religious education. I did a pro golf thing journaling class. So you're doing this imagery stuff and you're going back and revisiting past hurts and that kind of thing. But this in this friend had talked about about the stream Where She rescued this child from the real City hotel. There was this child in there someplace and she went in and Did this child? It seems like a really powerful image to me. I just kind of sat and with that for a while. I kind of Envision the CD hotel and I'm walking down the hallway and at the end of this hallway open the door in front of me my childhood home. I find myself the five-year-old self who's hiding in the bushes. And I remember the scene but the hiding from a couple of neighborhood boys who were laughing at me at the time. I don't remember why but that was what was going on and I had this Vision or have work with this image before and it was like always liked you go and talk to the child and tell her child. It's okay what ever it was blah blah blah blah and this time there is no talking. I was just grabbing up this five-year-old image of myself. And it has been hugely powerful thing because he had hasn't left me.\n",
            "Doctor: Tell me what the image means to you.\n",
            "Patient: Images just this deep sense of giving myself some love just like cradling those parts of me.\n",
            "Doctor: I can see that it's painful for you. Can you tell me what you're feeling right now as you're telling me about it?\n",
            "Patient: The sense of all those years of. Be able to do that all those years of this foolish child who just had been alone and hurt or whatever that is.\n",
            "Doctor: having to hide even\n",
            "Patient: Yes and can't speak and interesting enough. There's this mask. I'm wearing The Lone Ranger mask and a little cowboy hat.\n",
            "Doctor: the five-year-old\n",
            "Patient: Yes, this fight world and I got rid of all that stuff. You don't even need to have this on.\n",
            "Doctor: So you saved you comforted you hugs you?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, so I do meditation in the morning and I got this meditation bench. So the the pastor that I have is you kneeling on the floor in this bench and this 5 year old is just right from me and it's just it's really powerful imagery right now and it's that's really\n",
            "Doctor: It's almost like and part of my interpretation if it's not correct, but it's almost like I'm kind of walking with you through this image, but I imagine for the first time in being honest about your feelings. Not only do you validate them, but you comforted yourself. So in some ways you provide the intimacy that you needed because you believe that your feelings are true honest and valid and before you had been dismissing them.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and I really do feel like there's a sense of commitment to that. There's a sense of power to that. There's a sense of I know there's been no way that I can go back to whatever that was. So that's what a powerful game-changer for me sitting on Matt and Claire Carson's Workshop.\n",
            "Doctor: How did that go?\n",
            "Patient: It was good. The thing that I brought out of that was working with man is working with a deep sense of Shame some of the pieces started to fall together there.\n",
            "Doctor: Tell me about the pieces.\n",
            "Patient: My issue with having this mild deformity in my penis or my penis is this huge shame that has been the major defining defended kind of thing that's going out of my life and recognizing the power of that shame my God.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's almost like you've been multiple ashamed in multiple areas. So the penis is a symbol of manhood that for you is a source of Shame men. I was just having this conversation with my husband and this is what makes me crazy about our society how we how boys don't feel nana be a man which I think are the most destructive messages. You can give another human don't feel and if you feel you're weak or vulnerable and on so many levels. You've been told don't be don't be don't be you don't feel and in some ways. That's not even who you are. And so I'm doing all this damaging messages takes a long time.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, so I'm really trying to be patient with myself because yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, damn, I mean you some amazing work in a short amount of time. It's paperwork, but for\n",
            "Patient: Well, I'm not running away from it and I'm not backing down from it.\n",
            "Doctor: No, you're not.\n",
            "Patient: I got this really hugely Watershed stuff, and it's\n",
            "Doctor: It can either be painful ending or a new beginning or both.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it's already both and I just don't know what the new beginning is, but whether whatever was ending a long time ago and it's just recognition, but that was over now. Whatever comes out of what I don't know at this point. I still washed out to the mass and I'm screaming there ain't no love and there ain't no compassion and until that Tempest that dies down. There's going to be no reasoning with this right now.\n",
            "Doctor: What's it go ahead? Sorry.\n",
            "Patient: No, I was just going to say yes, it was yesterday because we had the snow yesterday that I was in this place and she was home from school. I was trying to get some work done and then it was so we had this conversation talking about trying to go down that road of talking about intimacy and recognizing that were talking to complete different languages and I recognized in just sitting there trying to knock it into counselor mode, but really just trying to deeply listen to what you were saying. I feel and hear that she was so completely petrified of moving down the road of\n",
            "Doctor: physical intimacy\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's there's just and she's just screaming against it and yelling at me.\n",
            "Doctor: yelling at you physically\n",
            "Patient: oh, yes, I can't go there and if I had some kind of thing that like if I was in a car accident and I was quadrilingual and you would stop loving me then to and I get you know, I get this is a very real thing for her and she says fine if intimacy is if that's so important to you then just go find somebody and have yourself a good lay and then so she's just yelling.\n",
            "Doctor: And then and then what?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I don't know and be happy or something. She can understand she can't hear what I'm saying.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure, because she's coming from her own place of fear. But again, it's unfortunate that she's not hearing what you're saying because for her it's about you're going to ask me to do something that I don't want to do and what it's certainly not unreasonable that married people have sex regardless of whatever age across the lifespan.\n",
            "Patient: You would think so it would be.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, but it's most married couples have sex.\n",
            "Patient: Well not according to her.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, but research shows differently.\n",
            "Patient: her research, however\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, but she's not be able to hear the emotional intimate piece physical intimacy is an outgrowth of the emotional intimacy typically in a marriage, right?\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: What was it like for you to kind of say these things to her and then get yelled at or not be heard.\n",
            "Patient: You know, I think again it was just pouring more gasoline on the Fire.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I almost hear that your needs were diminished. Like if you just want sex you go out and find it not just sex and sex is actually pretty important.\n",
            "Patient: She can't hear that. She's never been able to hear that and I get that now I get that probably all the way to the beginning of a relationship relationship, but that's not the way the relationship started which is still completely confusing because she was the one that initiated everything in the beginning and I\n",
            "Doctor: sexually\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and so that was so all the sudden we got this completely upside down relationship.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you think that having sort of the physical deformity and her cutting off sex 7 years ago?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, that was huge.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, how do you think those things kind of have impacted you?\n",
            "Patient: Well, it confirmed my worst fears that I wasn't lovable.\n",
            "Doctor: Even though that's not true.\n",
            "Patient: Of course and even though that wasn't what she was saying all of that aside deep down inside the story that I was really listening to that and that happened prior to seven years ago that happened.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure. Are you familiar with the narrative therapy at all?\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: You changed your narrative.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I know.\n",
            "Doctor: We're in an alternate story hear you change the dominant narrative.\n",
            "Patient: Well, tell me what you're hearing.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, well the diamond tip. The dominant narrative is what we've been looking at this whole time all these messages of inadequacy these messages about your worth and keeping your feelings but you as of last week or two weeks ago now just change the narrative completely like I don't want that anymore. We've been talking about the old scripts and how they weren't true and how your kind of really talented man who can pick up and do all three careers and do them well and how you're sort of a very deeply feeling man, even though. It's been told you've been told that's not okay. And you got rid of that negative narrative. It's brought you to a painful place but a very honest place and a place where so I'm hearing her kind of saying these things and diminishing your needs, but I'm also hearing that you did not take that in and say, you know what? You're right. Maybe I should but you would have That's how we know that the narrative has changed. You would have gone. Okay, you're right. Maybe I shouldn't want sex which is insane. It's insane.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it's insane. And that's what I did for a long time.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, same thing hurt is if your expectations were unreasonable, but they're not unreasonable their normal healthy expectations or a marriage.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I can see if I'm only if my only expression of sex was. sado-masochism\n",
            "Doctor: Sure, exactly. Exactly. And I mean, yes, it's her own Terror and things like this. I get that and have a lot of experience working with individuals of sexual abuse. I get that but the fact that it's a surprise that you need these things is troubling.\n",
            "Patient: It's not a surprise.\n",
            "Doctor: No, she's surprised that you are saying you need these things.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe not. I mean this is always been an issue and she's always it's always been this kind of thing. Like you can just love me for who I am. You got to have to have sex.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Can you take me back then before the kind of 7 year absence. Past the beginning part of the relationship you had three kids. You've had to have sex to have three kids.\n",
            "Patient: all three times\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, exactly. Yes at least three times. But so how was this what was being conveyed in your marriage? Let's say 15 years ago actually about sex.\n",
            "Patient: same story same story. I'm not sure what point the honeymoon ended. It didn't last long and I'm sure after the kids kind of like the sense of okay, I got three kids were done.\n",
            "Doctor: So sex was always an issue.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I don't know and I don't know if it's difficult to go back, but it's been a very long time.\n",
            "Doctor: And always the message was you always want sex. You always want sex.\n",
            "Patient: Can't you just love me for who I am?\n",
            "Doctor: Wow, that's a pretty loaded message. You know what it says. You're not supposed to want this from me what's wrong with you that you want me to have sex your depraved or whatever, which is completely not the case.\n",
            "Patient: But that's the but that's the relationship in overtime overtime and eventually got to the place where we couldn't have sex at home anymore. So sex was relegated to maybe it free or four times a year by going away for the weekend.\n",
            "Doctor: And then was it awkward or was it always initiated by you?\n",
            "Patient: I was pretty much always initiate by me and we got to the point that the only way you're going to have sex as if you had two or four drinks beforehand. So you had to get in the self-medicating state before you go there.\n",
            "Doctor: And how is sex after the medicated state?\n",
            "Patient: 4 functionally probably not satisfying whatever. Yes, you kind of just recognize this and it's just ugly ugly to call out of the garage out. But yes, I think that I got to the point that\n",
            "Doctor: Well, no wonder you stop having sex if you could told that something's wrong with you basically, or why can't you just love me for who? I am pretty soon. You're like it's not worth it.\n",
            "Patient: Well, I think yes, I think between Matt and for at least 10 years she had these premenopause migraine. So I mean if it's not a headache or working or the kids or whatever, there is no time when it's like wow, there's just no time. There's no time and then\n",
            "Doctor: You know what? I wonder sorry to interrupt you. It's almost like and obviously I don't know your wife, but it's almost like you know what their real fear might be about for her finding out. There's something wrong with her.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yes. I know that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, right. And so\n",
            "Patient: Because there's nothing wrong with her.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes. Well, so instead I say there's something wrong with you. There's something wrong with your expectation, but deep down. I wonder because I don't know. I think it's pretty common knowledge or maybe because I teach the human sexuality class but most married couples have sex around once a week younger married couples have sex more middle-aged couples usually has sex about one time a week. This is not anything that's unexpected out of the norm. It's really not and so I wonder if the fear is you're asking me to give you something. I can't give you I'm not capable out what's wrong with me. So it's just a lot easier to say what's wrong with you that you even want this. Well, of course he would I mean it's a healthy knead absolutely normal. Nothing wrong with it. It's the expectation that you would be having sex with your wife. What does of course sex is the smallest piece of this? This is not about sex sex is just a way to communicate emotional intimacy.\n",
            "Patient: Right in this and the conversation always gets derailed around this we end up talking about this and it's like okay. We're missing the point missing the point completely.\n",
            "Doctor: And if you could tell her right now what the point is in a sentence, what would be your point? But would you want her to know?\n",
            "Patient: You got some serious hurts and you're going to need to get them fixed and there's no hope for intimacy until you can fix that and I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: How would you define intimacy to her?\n",
            "Patient: Intimacy is the ability to completely learn about the other person and right now I know that I can't go there. I've never been able to go there with her because there's such a huge part of her life that I recognize that I can't bring my word ability to because that's like, okay. Well, I'm going to be completely open and burn a bowl with you, but you don't have to be\n",
            "Doctor: But in some ways you did by putting your feelings out there and by being honest even through anger, right? So you go from a place of not expressing your feelings to expressing your true feelings. Whatever they are in some ways he did. I mean, that's the amazing part about this. I'm not throwing that word around because I like it. I mean, it's amazing what you did after years of feeling stuck and silence and not being able to do this. You were dead honest unflinchingly about how you feel and what you want despite the fact that you've been told for so long that that's not okay some part of you doesn't believe that and you put it out there making yourself vulnerable and then refusing to take in any guilt about it or refusing to take in and this was not unkind. This is just really honest refusing to kind of continue in this place of being stuck. You're certainly not stuck anymore.\n",
            "Patient: No, no, and it's like screw it. I'm getting I'm putting my intimacy into my life.\n",
            "Doctor: well what do you think about this idea being thrown in your face of just go and find someone if that's important to you\n",
            "Patient: You know what to ascertain agree. I feel like I made this commitment to myself whatever a week ago 2 weeks ago and I said, you know, I already have friends. I already have friends. I have friends that care about me and I recognize some things about me who the hell says. I can't have relationships friendships. Can I just explore that?\n",
            "Doctor: She meant sexually though.\n",
            "Patient: I know she did and I'm not ready to go there.\n",
            "Doctor: No, and I'm not suggesting or encouraging you to do that. But I'm saying what do you think about her throwing that out you what did you do with that piece?\n",
            "Patient: It made me feel really cheap. It made me feel really angry like God.\n",
            "Doctor: That's why I was concerned about it was designed that comment was designed to minimize your sexual needs and to make you feel cheap, but it shouldn't.\n",
            "Patient: I didn't accept it. I mean I feel that and at the time I was in this place of listening to it, but I wasn't in a place of reacting. I went quickly to this place of you know what I can sit here and listen and I can just be in the moment and listen and that's all I can handle and I'm not feeling like not that I am having down my emotions, but I feel like at point. I'm just giving her the gift and allowing her to get it out.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure. Sure. So where does all of this leave you it's a lot?\n",
            "Patient: Well this morning and I recognize that for I don't know how many years I showed up Faithfully to Wednesday night choir practice and she goes out with the girls every once in a while. I go home after choir practice I go home and whatever watch a series. I've been watching on Netflix or whatever so last night. It was screw this I'm not going home anymore. I'm tired of sitting in front of the God damn television and wasting my life. So I asked him the guys. I don't want to go to the bar. But how about Starbucks? Do you want to grab a Starbucks?\n",
            "Doctor: Sure, and you did?\n",
            "Patient: I did.\n",
            "Doctor: Good for you. How did that feel?\n",
            "Patient: It was okay. I recognize I started listening to Graham Brown. Are you familiar with that name?\n",
            "Doctor: No.\n",
            "Patient: in type Brianna Brown, it's in that spelled b r e n e Brown and she got some TED talks on shame and vulnerability and they're hitting me in a hard place, you know, right kind of stuff and one of the things there was a little 5 minutes segments and you get to You get to the Ted Talk and there's a little five minutes segment where she's talking with Oprah, you know, it was just like a little segment of 6 people. You shouldn't share your inability with people who don't deserve your credibility and I recognized in the mist of this last night going out with this guy was like we're not going there.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, right. Well and that's okay.\n",
            "Patient: And that's okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You did it to get yes.\n",
            "Patient: I did it I said okay. I got to go now.\n",
            "Doctor: What would it be like for you to not go to choir practice anymore?\n",
            "Patient: Oh that's coming instead of going out with the girls last night. She went home, but she didn't tell me she was going home. So I get this text. I'm almost home. I get this text. So are you? Okay? Where are you? I came home after choir practice and you weren't here and I just I could have just started to feel it bubbling up.\n",
            "Doctor: it what it\n",
            "Patient: Rage anger and I said this all about clean now. This is all about recognizing that I put the goddamn nuclear option on the table. And now after 7 years are finally going to pay some attention to me. It's just it's just\n",
            "Doctor: I can see physically. It's like this early.\n",
            "Patient: And then I have ever seen in the morning. I have a routine in the morning for years and this has been spoken about its known I wake up very slowly in the mornings. I have and half hour to 45 minutes meditation routine exercise. I have to go walk the dog and I move I get up very early in the morning because that's my time. She got up this morning at 5:30 and she's out there making breakfast and\n",
            "Doctor: pissed\n",
            "Patient: And I'm getting up and I went out and I walk the dog. We normally walk for five minutes, but I just walked and I was so in touch with one of the other episodes where I was where I was that angry and I just ended up walking down the country road for about 3 miles and I wasn't coming back. It was just like I'm and I'm still\n",
            "Doctor: And do you know why you're so pissed? I mean, I think I get it, but do you know why?\n",
            "Patient: it's just too little too late.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, well, it's so intimacy. It's like putting a Band-Aid over a gunshot wound.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. So then\n",
            "Doctor: So you're going to make me breakfast now?\n",
            "Patient: interesting those words to me. So what I feel is I'm putting all this intimacy out here and you're just pushing me away, and I said I can't just turn it on like a spigot.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure sure, and it's still another representation of the fact that she doesn't even get what you're asking.\n",
            "Patient: She doesn't get it.\n",
            "Doctor: Like if I just come home from choir practice and make you breakfast, then we'll be okay and we can go back to what we were but you weren't going back that's not possible and it's not about breakfast right maybe a decade ago. It might have been about breakfast and talking over breakfast, but we're far beyond that point. It's in some ways. I would imagine it minimizes what you feel.\n",
            "Patient: I was sitting there and I'm physically felt like I was going to vomit and I was shaking I could barely talk. I was able to tell her that I'm feeling such anger and rage right now that I can't even function.\n",
            "Doctor: Good for you.\n",
            "Patient: And at that point I just got up. I just whatever I was doing. I was getting I recognized I didn't shave I barely remember to get my books. I said, oh man. I'm such a place here this morning. I can barely payment.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, because you can't live with the dishonesty anymore. I'd that's dishonest. You cannot live with the hypocrisy anymore. And there it is looking you in the face.\n",
            "Patient: It's all fucking around and I said yes sitting around in choir practice last night. I said, I'm so fucking tired of this. I'm living this lie. I'm done. I'm done with this shit.\n",
            "Doctor: I hear that.\n",
            "Patient: Done with so I recognize that this is a huge it's going to be we're not talking like I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Who else can you talk to you about all of these things?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I have one friend and I think at this point, unfortunately, I don't know. I don't know if it's fortunate or unfortunate, but we're both really kind of in the same boat right now.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, that might not be a bad thing.\n",
            "Patient: But I think we both recognize how needy we are how what the needs are for boundaries in this. So I think we're trying to really work on that but I feel so out of control.\n",
            "Doctor: very raw right now\n",
            "Patient: And I'm just I don't want to hurt anybody else.\n",
            "Doctor: Sheamus I don't think you're going to hurt anybody else. I don't think you need to worry about hurting other people, but you might think of other people even people who you might not have known long maybe even students in the program who you have a connection with\n",
            "Patient: You know, I do have a connection with some people and I feel like I've got people I've got a network of people here. Thank God. I've got a network of people here in a little bit here in a little bit there.\n",
            "Doctor: Use your network.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and I recognize that there's some professional boundary things that I've got to be really concerned about in that kind of thing.\n",
            "Doctor: Probably less. So with some of the students in the program given. They're in the same place. You can share a piece with a person and a piece with and that's one of the things I typically find with students in the program with students who support other students typically really good at doing that but you were processing this so you're in the middle of it. Like I said, I'm really proud of you even though I know that this is a really painful place, but I also know I mean, I want you to think about how much the stick out of you. I mean, I want you I guess I want you to know how Brave you are. This is an act of Bravery because if we went back to and we can because they're all on tape earlier sessions, even my mentioning the idea of your anger. You said I can't go there. Even the idea of thinking about talking to your wife brought up all this anxiety and you just busted through that in such a short amount of time.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I know and I know and I guess it's just the the way I don't know. I suppose if I sat and reflected on it, I suppose that that's kind of the way I do things.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, it's been a long time coming.\n",
            "Patient: Like planning and planning to build a house in finally. Boom. We're going to make it happen planning and planning to start your own business and it's like, okay. This is it. So I suppose that that's the way I do things. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, if anything comes up and you need to talk, even though we're on spring break next week. If you send me an email, I'll call you and I don't offer if I don't mean it. So if you say and it's the best way to get in touch with me because the phones right there. So if you say can you give me a call? I'll say yes. What time do you have? I'll definitely give you a call. That's never a problem.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: so if you still need to process this or if something happens and you need to Kind of explorer that please go ahead. And again, I will say I will never offer that if I don't mean it, so if you email me I will give you a call.\n",
            "Patient: Yes. No, it's yes. It's pretty in from earlier place.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I don't think you have to be afraid of it though.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's just looking at yes looking at the consequences of everything.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know in some ways. I think you've made the decision not to waste another day.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yes, that was definitely set.\n",
            "Doctor: So you're not stuck?\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm not stuck.\n",
            "Doctor: You've changed the course of what this could look like for you.\n",
            "Patient: yes, it's just that I've put in motion of getting some names of a couple counselors, but\n",
            "Doctor: I know some good ones. So let me know.\n",
            "Patient: I'll take suggestions, but I remember talking to someone who's this couples counselor. She said yes, I work with a couple it's just that I asked them up front. Are you with me on this and all the times? I get a lot of resistance you least give me 25% you're in on this and I got nothing. I'm bringing nothing to the table and I'll give you what I I will go but there's just absolutely nothing but today anger and rage. I I've got no compassion today.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure. Well, I the only person you need compassion for right now is yourself because you've not given you much compassion over the years. So right now I hope you are most compassionate with yourself.\n",
            "Patient: I can do that. Even though I'm getting the message of you being incredibly selfish.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I don't see it that way. Not that I'm an expert on such things. But I guess if I thought that there was some unreasonable expectation then I'd say let's look at your expectations, but I hear a very normal healthy expectations for a marriage nothing that's not nobody's perfect, but wanting physical and emotional intimacy from and with your wife stating that as a need is absolutely normal.\n",
            "Patient: It does sound pretty ridiculous just to be saying that in this room, doesn't it?\n",
            "Doctor: it doesn't sound ridiculous, but\n",
            "Patient: It sounds ridiculous that I would be thinking that and that would be acceptable.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I think you've been told for so long. So you will give me a call next week if you need to or send me an email and I'll give you a call right back. Please do.\n",
            "Patient: I will.\n",
            "Doctor: And I'm glad that we were able to get in today for sure. Let me know. We're back to our regular Tuesday time the week after next.\n",
            "Patient: Right not next week.\n",
            "Doctor: Not next week, but the week after next.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and she has a 3-day thing. She's going up with the band at the beginning part of next week. So.\n",
            "Doctor: So some relief there.\n",
            "Patient: I'll get a little bit of a respite.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, don't watch that movie now. No, I don't think you need to do that.\n",
            "Patient: I don't want to get watch that in the in the first place.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, well, I don't think we need the movie anymore.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and now I'm feeling like what I'm going to be dealing with is this clingy Behavior, which is all I'm going to be like\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe\n",
            "Patient: inflaming things\n",
            "Doctor: as long as you are honest and your feelings and in your words, whatever her behavior, if you find that objectionable, you can say why.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I suppose I can.\n",
            "Doctor: And so then you will find her behavior less objectionable because you're being honest about why it triggers you. So so as long as you're honest in your feelings and your behavior,\n",
            "Patient: Astro I'm going to stay with that\n",
            "Doctor: You have to stay with that because then you can be honest about why the cleaning is like nails on a chalkboard why that's not okay. And again, I think that's a pretty accurate accurate response not reasonable. Okay. Take care of yourself.\n",
            "Patient: I will I can.\n",
            "Doctor: And let me know let me know.\n",
            "Patient: And thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: No, it's I really enjoy working with you Seamus think of yourself as Brave incredibly Brave.\n",
            "Patient: I think of myself as\n",
            "Doctor: Yes for sure for sure.\n",
            "Patient: You seen The Lego Movie?\n",
            "Doctor: No, The Lego Movie. Is that a modern movie? That's out because I am so out of touch with modern movies. Do I need to see that?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm identifying with this little character. Who's the main character in the movie?\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. I'll have to look that up. Okay. Take care. Alright. Bye. Bye.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Here's the tally.\n",
            "Patient: okay thanks this is $100\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: so at least two\n",
            "Doctor: Great.\n",
            "Patient: how's it going\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: so last week is weird last week is very weird I was sleeping the whole week I don't know what the fuck was going on but I was sleeping every day until like two one I don't know like I was exhausted it was really weird\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder why.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know and it happens to me sometime so it's hard not to get a little hypo now hypochondria chondriac I don't know if it's that I'm snoring at night and I'm not resting so like I'm not going into a deep sleep. I don't know what the fuck it is, but the weird thing last week. Was it was all week? I mean it was all fucking week when I left her on Monday. Usually I go to Starbucks or just kind of or just try to get stuff done. I got all the way to Starbucks in or something in me. I could just feel like I was absolutely exhausted. I don't know but then. With all that shit with the fire department and the it was already an exhausting week. You know what I mean? Like it was a weird week. I was already feeling that way and then with all that shit, I don't know. But here's the weird thing Friday evening. I think or late afternoon and I saw this video this Army but who went from not being able to walk that well to like losing tons of weight. And I mean he was on disability. He was all messed up. So there's this amazing video of this guy who decided to learn yoga and you went to all these yoga teachers and told him and told them his story and they're like, it's really hard for you can barely walk. So it's going to be very difficult to do these poses one. Yoga teacher kind of took him in and look I lost a little weight and now he like runs. He's completely changed his life. Nothing is thing about it is I was sobbing I was like, maybe this is emotional Is it somehow emotionally backed up all week? Cuz I was like sobbing and it's not it's very anyone that doesn't get emotional watching. This video is an idiot. But to like be sobbing like that. I don't know. I just need to have a really good cry and then suddenly\n",
            "Doctor: Don't make a lot of sense if there's something emotionally you start feeling stuck and broken inside. Is it something about the video the story? I would guess it's not just a generic good cry, but something about the story let you let you get in touch with something.\n",
            "Patient: no, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like you were feeling all week.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess so.\n",
            "Doctor: Wonder what about the story?\n",
            "Patient: He seems like such a nice guy, you know, and I'm pretty skeptical skeptical. So it was also like the way the video was made with music at just is just made in a way that it touches all those buttons, but just the story itself the guy I mean, he was a fat he had to walk with those two things like crutches or whatever massive leg braces and stuff. He was in Iraq vet and they show him trying all the poses. He keeps following. I mean, it's just it doesn't get better than someone who seemed so sweet the so committed. You know what it is. You know what it is it like I can't explain part of it.\n",
            "Doctor: What were you going to say?\n",
            "Patient: well, I mean, it's just like cuz you to shame a little bit. I wasn't crying cuz of bad because but for someone to be able to overcome something like that and some one who seems so Who seems to deserve such a sweet person? It's just I don't know I was sobbing was really weird.\n",
            "Doctor: Put you to shame.\n",
            "Patient: Well, it's like I can't go to the gym for 15 minutes. See you in a little bit exercise. This poor guy is like seriously overweight disabled, you know, it gives you perspective. That's not why I was crying, but that's one of those things that took away which is which I think is what you should take away from it that the message of the video don't ever think you can't do something. I think that's what it was. The video was telling me something no one else had ever told me, you know, That you can do anything in the fact that someone believed in him, you know didn't give up on him.\n",
            "Doctor: That's a lot of feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Then I was trying to remember the other times when I felt so exhausted is this what happens something makes me cry and suddenly, I feel better. I think it might be sometimes you know, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You remember you were here Wednesday of last week. You didn't allude to feeling exhausted at all that day. You didn't seem it. A lot of stuff came up on Wednesday.\n",
            "Patient: I did I don't know anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean all different aspects of getting into\n",
            "Patient: Was Wednesday today? I was saying the weird shit my Mom said or something. Yeah, I often don't say that. I feel so tired because it happens kind of so often. But yeah, I probably should have mentioned it.\n",
            "Doctor: So you remember having that you have been feeling that way?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, no, no. No, I was really feeling really awful week really off. I mean, yeah that day. That's all I did. I came here and even that day I woke up right before I head come here and then back home. I got in bed and kind and just kind of took away like a long nap. Got up kind of ate something and got back into like I was just\n",
            "Doctor: depressed\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, like it was to the point to where I didn't mention it to my mom. I was feeling like so what the fuck is going on here. I couldn't even hide it in the evenings. I was just like yeah, I was just like totally like remember I was saying I was kind of going down there and not being talkative. Just there must have been I don't know. Maybe that's just going to happen. Sometimes like doing this to my mind tends to have so many. I'm trying to do so many things maybe sometimes it's just exhausting. I don't know or it gets the point where it's like a bottleneck these things are kind of flowing, but then maybe there are times when it suddenly it just gets kind of plugged up. So until I have a really good cry or something kind of Judges me over the that I just like feel drained or something.\n",
            "Doctor: When was it was it that your mother you showed her the photo of Kelly to your mom. Do you remember when that was?\n",
            "Patient: Was it the weekend or something like last weekend? Because I told you either.\n",
            "Doctor: You told me Wednesday.\n",
            "Patient: Wednesday so yeah, it was sometimes it was sometimes between the weekend and Monday.\n",
            "Doctor: Because I have to wonder if that what you told me about. Wednesday was not with you as a piece of what?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like I was handling it kind of but in a different way, I was kind of you know.\n",
            "Doctor: It was so much Ryan. I mean I was floored by in here and now things you were real and she had said to you that weekend and I don't know how that would have been like a punch in the stomach and you were handling it, but how could you not but how could I how could there not be you have different sets of eyes now and ears to hear and think about how what she saying to you that makes it now it's just a heavyweight when this actually happens now.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe like I just don't know what to do with that now and not going to run away from my hometown just cuz of you know what I mean. it's like how how do people and I know I'm not the only one how do people handle these things when they're Still kind of around their families in one way or the other.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you do with those feelings?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean you got to do something, you know, and I'll also you know what it was in retrospect cuz the other thing I thought after I had that good cry I thought maybe like over the weekend at some point. I mean she show Celia to kind of love you never gave me like how weird is that? It's just unconditional shoes melt like I thought of that and then there was one point where my uncle was over right around the fire department. I got upstairs to fix the garbage. I got a lot of shit done a lot of logistical fix some stuff around the house the garbage disposal just that day before replace some of the fire some of the fire alarms smoke detectors and I did my uncle was there he didn't do anything but he just because he was there at kind of help me to get some I was like, oh uncle. Can you I'm trying to fix the store that he looked at me. He didn't really do anything. But just another prayer eyes help me to be a little more motivated, you know what helps? It's not like my mom wasn't grateful to me, but I felt like she was more grateful to she made it sound like he did something. She was just a jerk about it. She doesn't get it, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: couch\n",
            "Patient: What's that?\n",
            "Doctor: ouch\n",
            "Patient: Yes, stuff like that or even or like even yesterday try calling. Calling her all day. Cuz if I don't hear from her for long stretches, I get a little worried like my grandmother or her in the snow or whatever her cell phone won't Buzz or she doesn't hear it. Whatever. It's like I don't answer my phone after a couple time. She is kind of aggravated. I don't say anything. I've generally concerned. I'm not annoyed. I don't give a shit if you're not answering. I just want to make sure everything's okay. It's just I don't know she just a difficult person. nauseous a lot there is to it. Like I said, it's not just with her kind of with the whole family. I just shown I'm just finding things more in a weird way more exhausting when they actually happen when things happen. They really annoy me and maybe cuz now I just know. What's what and I know there's not really. Much just say I mean it will be ridiculous to have some kind of blowout. So it's almost like this crazy like this very deflating kind of feeling I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's a very good question. What you do with all these feelings you're starting to have as things happen and you see them for what they are now.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I don't think there's much more that I could do. I don't you know, I mean, even if I go down there are you generally generally don't speak don't spend that much time at the most maybe an hour. I'll just dessert for like maybe an hour but rarely is usually just a few minutes. I don't know what else You know, I don't think it would even really that different if I live across town. You know what I mean? You're in the same your here. Your memories are here my and I don't want to run away. I don't put myself in this Tino. I'm kind of looking for my future now but my house and I don't want to give someone else a grand or two grand whatever it is for some shity apartment when I have a home that I'm comfortable and so it's a balancing active. I love it here. I don't want to live in another town. I loved it. So I mean, I think that's I think it is what it is in some ways. That's you know, maybe that's one of the reasons why I've been feeling better. I have a much more like I'm just taking care of myself, you know, they're not going to change their not. It is what it is. So I have to try to you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you say more about what the feelings are though? What do you feel?\n",
            "Patient: feelings about what\n",
            "Doctor: When she compliments our thanks you is is appreciated appreciative of your uncle and not now.\n",
            "Patient: I just feel like hurting angry, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: angry at\n",
            "Patient: I mean, you know. Like the thing is when I think about it, it's again the problem with all this shit is old feelings because that day when I first at the end of the day, it seemed like she was thanking him more but you could argue it's because he was leaving in a way. She's also smart lady. She wants to let a brother know she's giving him a little extra. To let him feel like she really cares. But he comes around and it's kind of she's kind of a sending him a signal. Do you know what I mean? But earlier when I first got home she hugged me All My Sons hear he's doing so much today and a steering in a Syrian. She said very nice things she gave me a hug. So it's one of those things where if I had to I had made a stink about it. I was just felt stupid right after I I had another blowout I would have felt like oh that was So when I sell in the moment had nothing to really to really do with that moment. It's just years and years and years of just feeling like she doesn't appreciate or she it all goes back to it doesn't feel unconditional doesn't feel you know, she's a sickle kind of person who sometimes it's very polite and kind of oddly when she is she's usually not like it's this weird. It's bury my grandfather.\n",
            "Doctor: And what were you talking about last week with a photo and all the exchange around the photo? It wasn't just about the past. Do you know what I mean? She's actually saying things in the present that are very very critical. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I guess when I say the past but I mean is that if everything else has been difficult your mom or your dad says something wacky to present you deal with it differently. It'd be much more than a little glitch like mon mom. There'd be more of a lightness about it. That's what I mean. I think I mean everybody I mean maybe not everybody is but from what I've seen around me, I feel like a lot of parents say some odd things that they maybe we don't intend to stay. But that can be kind of purple and frustrating. Whatever, but when it's coming after years of all this shit.\n",
            "Doctor: If it's a rare comment that comes from something.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, it's pretty it is pretty rare. She doesn't really say that stuff. I don't know. I'm not trying to defend her it's shity.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, what about this is hard to stay with how I felt. Wanting to defend her and protect her.\n",
            "Patient: What no. No it it took shity. There's no way around it. It's awful. I don't even know what to say about it. I guess I'm so focused on the Absurd of the other day and you do that helps me.\n",
            "Doctor: When you're with me you are.\n",
            "Patient: What?\n",
            "Doctor: focus on the Absurd serenity\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: When you're by yourself you complain.\n",
            "Patient: No, yeah, I don't think I'm focused on. I mean, I think I tell myself that. could try to feel a little better but\n",
            "Doctor: How do I feel what you felt watching this movie when you're here?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder why.\n",
            "Patient: I've always been like that, right? I don't really cry and her that much, you know, it's just very private I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: What if it would help?\n",
            "Patient: What's that?\n",
            "Doctor: What if it will help?\n",
            "Patient: Why I'm not against it it just I mean I asked I have but it has to feel has to come at house to can't force yourself.\n",
            "Doctor: another place where the couch can help\n",
            "Patient: What's that? Oh, well, maybe yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Again, it's just a tool. But that's also one of the things sometimes it can do. You can find feelings in here without someone staring at you.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right. Maybe that's what I need to try. I mean what I like about the way I'm handling. All this stuff is I think there's a lot to be said we're having a kind of like is what it is attitude and not in a bad way, but In a I don't know. I think it's feels kind of help me to be like, you know, what sometimes this is going to happen. Sometimes I'm going to feel whatever and sell last week or whatever. You know what? She's old and she's not going to be around forever. That doesn't excuse. Shepherd that helps me to just I don't know like in tandem with this because it is so like vulnerable and 3 days a week. It's awesome. I look forward to it. But I think the balance of this is it feels kind of good to be tough in a way like without ignoring how she is or whatever but just be like, you know what? That way, you know how to handle it. You handle it by giving a talk at the Assyrian Library. You handle it by doing your work? I already got the job. But you know what? I mean. I got invited to do a poetry reading whatever the biggest kind of creativity riding Association. Is having their conference year.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow, so not just a locally-based thing you're saying.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's National saying it's like the MLA my friend who runs this Workshop. Whatever the fucking thing they're doing a reading and she's like you want to be the featured reader.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: I haven't said yes, but I'm going to you know, it's really not a big deal, but these are the ways.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you considering not saying yes.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I kind of I kind of don't care but I'm going to say yes. I think these are the ways there's no other way. My mom's not going to stop saying those are shifters. Got2b a day. today you know, I think and I think that's the way that was the thing about the video and I think also part of the crying was again. It's that morning and then part of the crying was I'm finally kind of getting this now what I got level instead of up here and I'm like no I want to finish my novel and I want to do this reading I want To have a talk at the Museum in finish my record. That's the only way.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's a piece of what's changed so much Brian the last number of years and rapidly in the last since we started this is your capacity to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: To channel it now in two ways that are healthy for you instead of self-destructive most of the time.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right.\n",
            "Doctor: It's an enormous capacity to just grow. Yes.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I was thinking about it other than feeling shity about missing our appointments once in awhile, like things are City. Do you know what I mean? I'm not some programmed. I'm not doing my homework. I am living my life and I don't feel so guilty about the PHD or whatever. I think it's going to get it done one way or the other at some point, but I'm not sweating it but it's not my I'm not a fucking scholar. I don't give a shit about it. I want to finish it for me. So like I think that's the kind of stuff that does make me feel a lot better. I pulled up my manuscript for the new book and I was like shit man. Some of these poems are really fucking good. I had looked at them in months. There's really no other way. There's no other way. Also with Kelly but by not letting any of that affect we had a fucking amazing weekend. We had a such like she's awesome. I was going to tell you this if this is the first relationship I've had where the sex has gotten better with the more open. We've been even the littlest thing this past weekend was the first time I really felt like we were really making out is that weird like really making out in the stacks? I don't know if she's amazing. So that feels good. Like I'm not bringing any of that shit. Oh, she's a little overweight. She's I don't give a fuck. She's freaking beautiful and awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: And actually to find it when you're able to be honest with each other about sometimes when difficult things getting your first fight work it out. That's a relationship even the physical side of things actually gross.\n",
            "Patient: That was something that was awesome that it wasn't even a fight.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: You know what, I mean miscommunication.\n",
            "Doctor: First issue that you have to explore explore each other.\n",
            "Patient: That's amazing. We didn't even have any words.\n",
            "Doctor: No yelling screaming.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, she's like hey, we haven't talked in a couple of days. She came over and was like and that was it. I already see you like Friday. Thought we were just going. To get together Saturday. She's like do you want to get together Friday to I Can Tell She's after that. But all whatever is that was we both talked. We were both scared. She's very it's different. It's different.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder if Wednesday was too much.\n",
            "Patient: I mean the whole week was too much but maybe\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe you're just like and we laughed about saying mental health break or taking mental health days. Maybe you needed a break from here on Thursday.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe the whole week felt like that.\n",
            "Doctor: You know, I think I may have said this before could have been years ago. There's a psychoanalyst psychiatrist whose well known around town died a number of years ago, but remained a legend in the area who describe the process of therapy basically as acknowledging bearing and putting it into spec into perspective as a three-stage process.\n",
            "Patient: That makes sense.\n",
            "Doctor: I bring it up right now because I think that what used to happen for you if you would acknowledge and it would just fly you into a panic and it would be totally deregulating what would start to get to know about and you've been increasingly finding a way on the outside, even if Even if just finding perspective around it, and I think that's what you're describing feel. So important to you that you can say it is what it is what it is in some ways that's telling oneself to put it in perspective. The only thing I'm bringing up is that in here, I think sometimes you also want to jump over the acknowledgement jump overbearing and into putting it in perspective that the bargaining part is hard.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Of course.\n",
            "Doctor: If we only land in perspective without ever having gone through how bad it feels what you have come to know. It's a shaky container.\n",
            "Patient: Right, of course because some days that perspective work some days. It doesn't.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, if you're never really mourned and grieved and gotten angry or so that you know, it snowed in your bones and effectively it's a different kind of knowing it's more like a muscling through the perspective which is so adapted that I think works for you A lot of the times out there.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree.\n",
            "Doctor: Where you at?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I just think what happens is like part of that side of me. That just says well, I mean there's kind of No time limit on morning, so it's just that. That makes me scared. But it just makes me feel like the acknowledging part is definitely covered that you know, I feel like the bearing is like that's kind of what I've been doing away. I know what you're saying, but I kind of feel like I mean maybe the way I feel about it is like this is really helpful because when I'm alone I can stop and not the minute, you know what I mean? To me. That's what works. It's a very private thing to me. I don't know. But when it happens now, I don't feel weird. I don't feel bad. It's my kind of welcome mat, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're saying it actually could be helpful this time it unstuck something.\n",
            "Patient: It always does.\n",
            "Doctor: Like for you to find the feeling.\n",
            "Patient: No, it always does it always does.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: The last time I felt very disturbing was the time I told you when I first got to London.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: That felt really unsettling and I was only because I just felt really alone. I felt like there wasn't anybody I could call or hang out with I just felt really weird and alone and just unsettled ever since then every time I had a job like that. I always understood the clear reason more or less and I've always felt better.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so you're doing work in Berry now?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: by yourself\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, I feel like the stuff at home was almost like the homework like that's the stuff you got to you know, and I do wish it would happen in here more. I mean, it makes me a little uncomfortable, but I've been doing this long enough. I'm fine with it. That's just not it's got to just happen. Naturally you can\n",
            "Doctor: Their time than here where it looks like it's going to but then you stop it's like you're clamping down. And you'll say it but whatever dismiss away from it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, maybe.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it mean something I wonder what it means just to have the feelings in there?\n",
            "Patient: I mean I had the feeling that actual crying thing is hard for me to do not her is just it just doesn't happen in front of people that I just and I'm fine with that. I'm not trying to hold anything back some people but I do know what you're saying for getting the crying thing. But I mean it's hard to you know, because I Tyler's don't know what to say about it. I feel I feel it. I don't know. What's shit. It makes me feel like shit. I just don't do you know what I mean? Like literally I don't know what the other will eyes say it say that it makes me feel shity or something. Maybe you're right. Maybe that's a way to not sit with it or whatever. Remember when I told you that last week, I've lined up some dates on. Okay stupid. Well, I didn't go on any of them. There's this one girl, who when we started talking and we we we realize that we were already Facebook friends. So it is I feel guilty now, but I'm going to tell her and send her an email like look full disclosure added situation. That was a little complicated. It's no longer. It's kind of gone to the next level. Is it bad enough? Like she's like a musician. We have kind of the same Circle. She's a musician and studies like trauma in therapy. So it is there is no reason to feel guilty right if I just hang out to make a friend have coffee with her or something.\n",
            "Doctor: You're looking for like permission to? Absolve your guilt or something.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, because I feel like I'm being a little overly sensitive, but I have no intention of anything.\n",
            "Doctor: and you've communicated that\n",
            "Patient: Well, I'm going to we had made plans, but I'm going to send her an email me like full disclosure. This is what's going on. You seem cool. We have a lot in common and we know all the same people. Could we just grab a coffee?\n",
            "Doctor: why would you feel guilty?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's because I care so much I just You know how I get things are going so well with Kelly. I feel like I just want things to keep going. Well, I don't want any weirdness which is why that's why I'm saying I feel like I'm overthinking and being really, you know,\n",
            "Doctor: Although if she heard you heard you when you met someone new who you met on you get caught in the context.\n",
            "Patient: of course, that's a gray area. But my feelings is obviously the part that part doesn't need to come up. She's somebody she's someone that I'm Facebook friends with only she's a musician have a feeling that some point are circles will overlap anyway, and you know how I am and I'm kind of good at networking and I just feel like you never know. It's good to\n",
            "Doctor: So your motivation then meeting her sounds like it would be more like in networking.\n",
            "Patient: Networking and it's also nice to I don't know a lot of people that are so interested in like trauma and who are musicians just to remember what I was saying about my friendships and like I think I at this point they're like, Donnie Mike Matthew three or three or four people at this point who are regularly. I don't know. I just think it's important to start branching out. You know what it is you down of matter what I'm still not quite over the feeling of being totally alone. You know, I think that's in terms of like really feeling that's the feeling. I'm just I'm still not quite its way way better when I'm voice like Donnie like I don't feel alone. I feel very connected. But because all of this all of that is all is relatively new. It feels like it could just go away or whatever. So I realized how deep I feeling is you know that I just feel kind of\n",
            "Doctor: even here\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You can feel fragile uncertain you could feel alone. Even when you're here. That's why I asked you about actually crying in the fact that it only happens in the most vulnerable way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Nautilus, not with company\n",
            "Patient: Brightwell Cecilia's here\n",
            "Doctor: That's a start.\n",
            "Patient: It really is I think.\n",
            "Doctor: I wanted to mention to you a time change possibly if you wanted if you wanted although it would have required a change and I don't know how do you feel about that? So few things if so if you need to think about it.\n",
            "Patient: I'll take it.\n",
            "Doctor: I have one on Wednesday opening up.\n",
            "Patient: I'll take it.\n",
            "Doctor: We do Wednesday Thursday Friday, so it would be three and three in a row.\n",
            "Patient: Perfect.\n",
            "Doctor: Would that work?\n",
            "Patient: Skip\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, okay. So starting next week. Do you want to do that?\n",
            "Patient: so next week is when I'm going out of town with Kelly.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: So I won't be here Monday.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: So and I think I won't be back in time Wednesday.\n",
            "Doctor: for Wednesday\n",
            "Patient: So maybe next week we can so I'll miss Monday, but we can keep Thursday Friday.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, absolutely.\n",
            "Patient: And then the week after yeah, totally.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so the week after starting Wednesday the 20th.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah do Wednesday Thursday Friday?\n",
            "Doctor: Great. Okay, that works.\n",
            "Patient: That's awesome. So it'll be one 12:50 and 11.\n",
            "Doctor: 11250 and 11:30\n",
            "Patient: 11:30\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, and soon the 11:30 is going to change that 3:10 lots of changes. I know that this is getting confusing with the schedule.\n",
            "Patient: no, no. No, it's awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so we'll stick to Thursday Friday this week and then start the new one next week.\n",
            "Patient: That's awesome. Cool. Thanks for sure.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Have a good rest of the day. See you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: This weekend so figure out whatever it is to figure out.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I can figure it out.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, good luck.\n",
            "Doctor: Thanks.\n",
            "Patient: Haha, and you know, let me know what I can do.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: So we went to visit him at the stake house yesterday took the kids to work with her. She kind of she suggested that something that she thought would be nice and that morning and she's like, I'm really not motivated to go to work and I was like, you should take the kids with you a little bit Roth like Mary had been difficult or things have been difficult for her whatever anyway, and he was like not really was really fancy stuff and I don't like fancy stuff. Okay, so I sort of thought a lot yesterday about what we talked about on Wednesday and then kind of put it all the way out of my head. I think what I came to was. Yeah. I think you were really really write that like I'm saying this is how things are and kind of disavow mean a lot of the ambiguity there and a lot of the know this isn't how things always are. I'm not sure how much of that is coming from being angry was one of those things that is very hard to think about which I feel like probably means that there's something there, you know, I kind of like my mind certifies off of it. I feel like this case a lot of it is so I think I got really scared by the side that like, none of the things that usually works to help me. We're working and maybe it's easier to say this is predictably always the case and then it's not always the case, but I don't really know why things get so bad some days and not about other days and I don't have any way that I can to make a difference. One thing. I thought was interesting was like analogy and like it would never have occurred to me to think that people who are talking about sports all the time when it wasn't interested. We're like being rude like that was an echo of like, oh that makes sense. It was like what you know, so I don't know ya things have not been so hard the last couple days. So that's good.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but again, like I don't know why this is where it's like most of it feels like most of the things that most of the like therapies that I was in the hospital Burberry, like coping your towards coping skills, which makes sense. This is where all that breaks down because I feel like I'm actually getting pretty good at that part. I like at saying when I do this this results, when I do this this results, like what are the ways that I can change my environment to help me like I've gotten to where that sort of high on my priority list and it's something that I work on actively and it's something that I'm not terrible and then sometimes it just doesn't work.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, probably most of us what we talked about exaggeration, but\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, because you know if it doesn't work, but I'll need to talk to you about it. I don't need to plan Earth would I come in and say these are my small victories of the last days but\n",
            "Doctor: I can still make you feel like such a failure or so incompetent.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, you know and also angry at everybody else who you know both people for whom like once they learn how to use these coping skills like that actually fixes things. I'm not sure if those people exist but people certainly talk like those people. Yeah, I guess I feel like I feel like I've been set up to believe that when these things fell for me. That means that I'm a failure and part of me sees this as to stop by that and part of me believes that you know, sorry, I don't have to actually clean my glasses. I just write them on my shirt whichever shirt. I'm wearing which leads me to never having glasses. Yeah. I feel like I'm failed and I feel like I I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Like I'm deformed in some way or something similar to talk today about what You just asked me like how much I was talking with people about the ECT. Well, then, you know sort of depends on the day and who I'm talking to but actually kind of a lot which led into you know conversations about like is there a stigma surrounding mental illness? What does it look like? Like I have somewhere I was headed and I don't remember. Oh, yeah, I think I guess I don't think this is a very nice thought but it's something like undeserved suffering scares the shit out of people. How do they deal with it? You know, I guess I mostly see that argument made in talking about like sexual harassment raisin, like blaming the victim a lot of my Facebook friends well and art like, you know aren't readers of Jezebel. That's why I kept reading a lot about it and I sort of Go back and forth. It's like I don't it scares me when I don't feel like I have done something to deserve what's happening to me. So that's yeah, it scares me last one, you know things got to be okay again, and I don't feel like I've done anything to deserve that you somehow I sort of got over that. Haha or think about it last or yeah, you know, that's not really something I can like talk to people about because this sort of knee-jerk response of like that things get better for yourself and I'm like good for you. You should be run like hell. Yeah. I'm very proud of a lot of things but sometimes like sometimes it just happens or it feels like it just happened. Yeah, maybe if I look at it too closely. Well, I'm doing well without to make it go away where to get spices and you know on the way back there's beer there's a bar and it had some of the signs outside and it said like good news ladies alarm bar. Stop a single and I would like to laugh and then I was like that's actually kind of sexual harassment and I was like, I don't know until I talk to James about it and it's like well, you know I saw\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not sure.\n",
            "Patient: Think it's funny and I want to think it's funny. But like now I can't let go of seeing it as kind of creepy witch, you know, James can let go of those things. I think you know me a hard time about not being able to go because you know, he certainly knows it's really not. Okay, but I'm not really sure the connection is there something is like sometimes I just you know, like I want to be able to laugh at the joke or like listen to the song without that it's coming on every single radio station without actually that's really kind of a song about date rape and that's probably not. Okay. Yeah, but I also like don't want to be full of rage and exhausted better by all these things. I hate you ever, you know, every hour of the day, so I don't I told you about the and I want to talk with him. You said that becoming a field agent really helps him get in touch with the rage. Is that right?\n",
            "Doctor: I don't remember.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you did mention it.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, that's okay. Yeah a couple months ago. Are like earning a PhD in theology really helps get in touch with his rage? I think that was\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sure the other one made sense, but that more obviously just like adding him getting a PD for PhD. In what ways do you mean that?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like it's I don't know. I guess I'm sort of circling about thinking about anger and some things it's like I have to sort of step back for me being angry about just because like it will make me last then I want to be your make me less of myself and I want to be like, it's just exhausting and I don't know it just has to be done. I guess I'm thinking mostly about like feminism right now. Yeah that's being angry about it gets to where it hurts me rather than helps me and then some things I don't know. It's like it's bearable to consider myself as somebody who's angry about things. That's how they used to be. Well, I guess the important thing I get to decide once I'm done being angry.\n",
            "Doctor: icing\n",
            "Patient: I would like when James tells me that I should be done being angry about feminism that it doesn't go well. That's not helpful, and it doesn't end well for him. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: anyway, like maybe in the role of you know, encouraging you to feel whatever you feel and have your feelings and your kind of explaining to me why you want to be angry all the time. And if you start it can be hard to and like just make him somebody you don't want him to be to me as though it was as if I had made a case for some other way, you know, James dang. Well, turn it off now and saying will yeah, you should probably turn that on.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. Yeah, I guess I feel like there's like some big gap or like something that I'm not seeing or not taking account of or taking into account when you know, since I can't see it. I don't know where to look. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: a lot of like we've been talking about is bad things just happening like that Depression started to like like sexual harassment and rape and I sort of other like\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know in a sense. I feel like you know, what a lot of the time I feel like sex is also something that just sort of happens and I like happens to everybody and we don't know how to get out of it. And I think about somebody like Ted this guy that I room with you. Like I'm pretty sure he was a sociopath like you just did not give a shit about anybody like you just did not care and I don't know. I don't know. I just I don't know how to hold people responsible for things don't I don't know so as everybody's talking about sports instead of leaving me out in this cold. Like, how do I hold them responsible for that? I don't know. I don't know. You know, I stay and I think well now you probably could hold them responsible. Like when you are in a social situation, it is your responsibility to like pick up on other people, you know want need out of that conversation, but like, you know, a lot of people are really really bad at that like a whole lot of people and I don't know Or trying, you know like to find a scope of the problem that it just not working out. I sort of like recognized that also is your job and you know, it's not my job to be able to fix all my problems myself. I'm not very good at.\n",
            "Doctor: Also kind of being talked about being kind of like angry and sort of having strong judgment that comes in a various ways. Like people do this bullship saying why they find some reason why something awful should have happened or find some reason. Yeah. That's right.\n",
            "Patient: Find something awful should not have happened or should not.\n",
            "Doctor: Might not have happened or it happened because of this see you. So obviously if that had to happen different or if you had done this, you know. you don't think\n",
            "Patient: I don't think I don't think that's a\n",
            "Doctor: oh, okay, and you were saying like that's bullshit and that's defensive I think.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And it sort of seems like you and James were on one hand you want to be able to like let-go stuff that makes you angry just because you don't don't want to be burdened by it when you're just walking down the street having a nice time at the same time. Like he's not going to be the one to tell you.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: About why you should or shouldn't do that. I guess I wonder if like clearly you or I think you have kind of a degree of comfort and doing that with James like\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know how you do so much with me and I\n",
            "Patient: probably right\n",
            "Doctor: I imagine that maybe some of your feeling kind of at a loss or more difficulty than there was putting things together is because it's made you anxious to sort of feel in these ways, but it also occurs to me. so it's all right.\n",
            "Patient: by pointing out you make it okay for me to acknowledge. Sorry and Rob people sentences. I'm not really bad with James. I don't think that would be\n",
            "Doctor: What I was thinking was like like a bad depression and sort of doing a like post post mortem of what happened and why you're depressed and sort of doing everything. Well, I guess that just happened sometimes like that. Sounds like me, you know.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe I'm wrong, but in some sense like the last thing what happened and I'm like the thing which you don't think was really pushing your buttons was, you know, like whatever. So, I guess that makes me wonder if there are things that could pointed to you and my direction without really really realizing it that I think actually was a point where you pause and forgot your saw a few minutes ago. But anyway,\n",
            "Patient: Which direction?\n",
            "Doctor: Like I wonder if it's but like, you know, sometimes people talks all these stories about why you no depression happens and what the logic is this and that because they don't want to see just bad things happen. I don't know if that was\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so.\n",
            "Doctor: I know you consciously did not intend that but I wonder if that example of sort of bad might have been making you anxious.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks, because like I said that you both with you know, taking everything to pieces and also staying in like know sometimes bad things just happen. Like what we do is figure out how to deal with that. So, yeah, I don't have to trouble knowing what to do and what to think when you know, you kind of put forward ideas and then I don't know what to do when I feel like the wrong or when I feel like they don't fit because like sometimes I sit with them awhile and when they turn out to sit for a while and that's you know hard to handle. Sometimes they still don't fit and I fell so hard to handle and I don't it's like both really are important to me to trust my own judgment in this and also really sort of I don't know if that's increasingly hard, but it's pretty hard at this point. And so yeah, I don't know what to do and ends up being more or less useful because I sort of forgot about it for a while and then I end up thinking about it pretty hard and that's also useful. But yeah, I mean, I think there's also like I feel guilty like you are mistaken. I feel like So when I say like no this doesn't fit and then with the passing of time it comes to seem like I feel like very very ashamed of that. It just gets really embarrassed that I feel ashamed. So there's a lot of encouragement to not trust my own judgment in the first place there.\n",
            "Doctor: IC imagine you feel ashamed mostly when that happens play because if you feel like you're kind of messed it like kind of\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: early because at times I feel like you're kind of irrational and reacted kind of with an emotional bias that in a way that affected your judgment or something and that feels crummy.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess that's right. I guess I kind of was saying like I just feel really stupid. I feel like I should have seen this.\n",
            "Doctor: I see also part of why also part of why part of what for me if you should tell me something does it fit that I'm going to feel really stupid and ashamed what we should stop.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Come on Inn.\n",
            "Patient: Morning.\n",
            "Doctor: Morning.\n",
            "Patient: So I wrote a check for you and I forgot to bring it. So I'm very sorry about that.\n",
            "Doctor: It's okay.\n",
            "Patient: So we ended the last session you sort of talked about Siri and what we're doing here in your construction of it. So I'm that I do not have anything to say, but I guess I want to say thank you and I appreciated you talking about it. It it it took me a few minutes after I left to sort of sort out my feelings, but I was very grateful for you to you were talking about it just it was it was interesting and also comforting and sort of reassuring. Like you were saying that not only is it essentially okay that I interact with the world and a particular fashion, but it is necessary that we construct their use to make sense of our reality. I also felt like you were sort of I don't want to say casually dismissive of like particular strengths of theory and I like that and anyone who is an expert at something. It's nice because it's sort of I mean, I got bogged down and sort of questioning everything. That's not always necessary. That's nice.\n",
            "Doctor: when you say casually dismissive of\n",
            "Patient: I so you started said that you know that Psychotherapy gets a bad rep and deservedly so we're focusing too much on everything comes from your childhood. But then you go to develop the second order of theory of it's important but it's important because of the way you construct Lincoln trucks theory is about how one exists and continues to do so your time. So but you know that sort of casually dismissive of that string theory Oh.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh not even casually.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I meant offhandedly.\n",
            "Doctor: taken\n",
            "Patient: but fair enough\n",
            "Doctor: well, there's certainly that contract for some people make is very meaningful, but I'm less interested in some specific structure of it and the fact that the structure is important that The importance of having a structure but the particular kind of structure being wed to a particular kind of structure I think is problematic.\n",
            "Patient: I'm I'm not at all surprised to hear you say that. But it's sort of like we've been doing this for a long time and it's not like we have talked about. What we're doing, but you're also providing in some ways more details here than you have at other times or makes more sense in these last two discussions is also nice because I feel like you you're talking about what you do and it's important to you. I find that interesting so\n",
            "Doctor: Well, and I'm sharing with you how I think about things.\n",
            "Patient: Yes. Yes. Thank you for that.\n",
            "Doctor: And that I have reasons in so in some ways I have very clear ideas about how I think about things. It's not random.\n",
            "Patient: What was that last part? You said? It's not random.\n",
            "Doctor: That it's not that I have that not only am I sharing it but that you're sort of your seeing that there are certain areas that I have been clear have very clear ideas about like something that I have thought about in developed. It's not random or like maybe this or maybe that no, I want to know what you're thinking, but I think maybe I even if I'm thinking about why I even said that I about well, I think that you know knowing you that this is something you appreciate and there's sort of a lot of forethought into how someone goes about doing something.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, you're very proposed Civ and what you do and that and some ways that has been very clear. So you're sort of saying yes, of course and it's in this particular fashion. Yeah. I mean that's also reassuring but I guess I was sort of sitting here wondering why you would say that but you just answered but I'm also wondering whether I have like suggested to you that I think what you do is random because I don't I don't think that's how I think about it, but\n",
            "Doctor: No, I don't think that way either but I was just the thought came to my mind was maybe this could be more generalized. But certainly, you know, when Tanya when she was sort of in and out of the hospital you were sort of meeting with people and you thought do they actually know what they're talking about. It was very scary and enraging at times do they actually know do they actually have an idea what they're talking about? Maybe more generally like this concern like do other people in charge know what they're doing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and in many circumstances the answer is sort of I know you sort of you push on that idea before and suggesting that I perhaps undervalue the extent to which the people who are doing things are doing them for a reason that might be true. But so in that instance another thing that I found very frustrating about it was that sort of goes through the same sequence when they need Tanya so it was like they hear her story and they seem to start constructing essentially a similar sequence of series as if while securing the history in which she is talking about seeing a whole bunch of other people and who do their job they are recognizing that the other people will have constructed the thing theories and at their first conclusion has probably already been tried that sort of So it's sort of like, you know, you were giving in many ways a very complex level of theory and to you, you know, it's I guess it's simple and that it's it can't be expressed simply but it's all so yeah, I guess I feel like at the As I understood what you were saying. You would say something like well, obviously these things that have been that have happened in Chinese life are important but at least as important as she has responded to them. And the sort of responses she has constructed internally and the narrative she has constructed internally to explain what is going on in her life. Maybe everyone in your discipline feel the same way or believe the same things or I don't even feel so many things but that's not at all clear. So yeah. This is also related to trust more generally there is a there's a sense in which I seem to look for probably something this is probably some specific marker, but I don't know what I could articulate what all of them are that indicate that there's a forethought into what's going on and that an understanding of both what's being done and the effects that is having because most organizations have a structure and mow structures do something to the people in them and not just something to the final product also.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, and you're acutely aware that all organization organizations. I was going to say most but all organizations are far from perfect and not difference between how you feel. They ought to run and how they actually run. Is this appointing. I think sometimes you're not sure what to do with that disappointment like whether you should trust them at all then.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and that disappointment is related to this you suggested I have a tendency to despair. Is go ahead you agreed like you were going to say something.\n",
            "Doctor: well Hublot the disappointment slides into that\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. That's right. And so, you know, I've been working on it describing that as of thing that happens is has been helpful. And also you we spend a lot of time talking about things could be non-ideal and still okay and still even good. Yeah, I think in a general sends, it seems helpful to have the non-ideal ideality be acknowledged. But there are unhealthy ways of doing that people will say things like well nothing is perfect. That's true. But that's you know, that's the if my view of things is not ideal and therefore bad it's naive then the converse is also naive nothing's perfect. So anything is okay is equally ridiculous. Really?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, that's sort of a promotion a blanket permission then that's the problem.\n",
            "Patient: That's yeah, and I often feels that way to me. It's like well, you know, we can't make it perfect so we might as well just not try to do anything at all.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, and you see that perfectionism in Tanya although it typically manifest and more in relation to herself. I mean she feels mostly we and then most dramatically when she feels falling short of being perfect, but the issue of perfectionism is definitely like I think you can relate to that just it's not sort of you don't hold yourself to the kind of virginity she does. Are you confused by my comments on Earth?\n",
            "Patient: No, nomadic infused. We're doing something different today than we usually do. I'm pleased by it. So so\n",
            "Doctor: How do you mean what what things are we doing differently?\n",
            "Patient: I feel like you're talking a lot more and I also feel like you're it's as if you're pushing and some specific Direction, you're continuing to bring us back to some set fixed. I don't know if my I don't know how the I don't know how it's working on your end. And I feel like I have now Disturbed if I talk about it, but\n",
            "Doctor: Then. There's certainly intentionally you're in putting the I'm I'm not feeling like I'm going into a particular direction directions consciously, but\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I guess I yeah, that's fine. Anyway, yeah, thank you. You're keeping things moving in a particular line of some of the things that we've talked about before to continue the conversation. We're having to present. It's not that you don't do that ever, but you several in a row anyway, so Tanya perfectionism me not the same internal rigidity. Yes, and it yeah and it's really problematic. I'm like, I understand the desire for your Perfection, but you know, I don't think you and I talked about But she and I and dr. Janice talked about. Talk to a couple weeks ago about anger and the sense in which one of them not the only but one of the causes of herself injury and suicidal suicide is her utter inability to deal with the anger from anyone else or herself. That's my description of it. There is not theirs but she'll get angry and she's not allowed to express the anger by herself. She does not allow herself to express the anger because any expression of anger is bad because I don't know. I don't follow the logic of it. It's a particular motion or traumatic logic, but it's not okay to express anger. And so she internalizes it something like being angry because she is angry of becoming angry at herself for being angry at someone else and wanting to express that and buttons up and self-injury and if it goes on long enough course particularly acute suicide, so, you know now I guess you were talking about ways that I can understand and relate and I'm talking about now the piece that I really can't relate to buy. Now I have the sense that by talking about what we're doing. I've just I've Disturbed it. I know that that's not strictly true, but\n",
            "Doctor: Disturbed what we were doing and talking about it like you ruined it somehow. Yeah, really interesting choice of\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's a really interesting choice of words. Yeah lost is the word that comes to mind more than ruin. But yeah, there's a sense of yeah, I guess there is a sense of Ruin to it just isn't that you know, I understand why you ask a question before is sort of resume the word does does that make sense? So or sometimes the opposite happens? It's like very much. Yes, and then also like yes, I can see why you were asking that question make some kind of particular sense. Yeah, yeah like by talking about it. I made it go away. So yeah, there's a sense of ruined. I think of course, there's also a you know by asking the question you were also demonstrating that wasn't really true. So kind of an interesting, you know, I feel like a question is about how I interpret the world and sort of us are really fundamental way in a conversation that we're having that's about how I interpret the world but I also feel like one of the things that you sometimes suggest is that I interpret the world for lack of a better world incorrectly. Like I am not ruin this conversation in any real sense. I prescribed it in the sense of every time one of us speaks a conversation is altered by that's the meaning of conversation so\n",
            "Doctor: They're the sort of Truth router sessions. There are sort of X in the session where it seems like your kind of attentive to your thought process and there are times where it seems like you're kind of acutely aware of sitting in front of you and dealing with that. That this moment.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And I'm not sure what you know, it's certainly not one thing. Maybe it's to some extent unknowable, but it's still interesting what creates those shifts.\n",
            "Patient: I think I think there's a difference in I mean like I don't have an answer but I feel like a large part of what we're doing here is struggling to interpret or understanding what's going on in my life for me. When we get to a point where I feel like I understand something and often my focus will shift to talk to you in some sense. It's like that's where we start the session is, you know, I am acutely aware that your present then I come back to that when I feel like I have things in hand or something like that. But that maybe that's a good description because that's also somewhat true emotionally. So the couple of times we sat largely in silence for periods of time you suggested during one of those. But you thought it was very important to give people space. That's just a thing that was missing from our culture more generally. So years ago I used to be able to like look at a person and think while I was doing it. Somewhere. I don't know early in my Ph.D program. I stopped being able to do that. I don't know exactly why something like being acutely aware of what's going on with you Enterprise my thought process so I it's not helpful by my advisor who has like very bright blue eyes and sits very attentively like like a Pleasantburg, but it was just like has a very intense gaze and we'll wait for you to talk.\n",
            "Doctor: like a pair of puss\n",
            "Patient: In many ways. Yeah, but much more expected Lee. I feel like especially you and you sit and I feel like there is an expectation that I will speak but your gaze is not particularly expecting if that makes sense. Like you're not staring at me like okay. What are you going to say now? It's your turn to talk. Whereas in some ways that suitcase Gerard has I don't think he I think she both realizes it and doesn't not realize it. It's the gays he has after he's asked if there are questions in the class or ask a question. She will look around the room and wait for someone to respond. He seems perfectly content to wait for long periods of time or some it has the effect of when there are actually question. Someone will eventually ask a question but\n",
            "Doctor: So do you think that's continent or what was ashlea?\n",
            "Patient: Cozumel\n",
            "Doctor: Call Zenobia.\n",
            "Patient: I have no idea. I observed it both, Kurt. I think you know as an explanation, so I've read recently. So I ride wrestler recently at that old people are not any dumber than they were when they were young. We cannot 70 they just have a lot more information to process. And so it takes them longer to find a particular facts.\n",
            "Doctor: interesting\n",
            "Patient: I don't know if it's true, but it was I found a whole lot in the last several years. Axe. I find when I'm learning a whole lot all at once like this is longer process individual thing. So I think these two things happening at the same time pulling into it and maybe make sense in this context for one way of describing. Why is that I can't process all of what's happening or happened. So\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's why people come to therapy and general sort of the fireworks. They have for processing that aren't working. There's too much new experience to incorporate and it's not fitting into the you know, the pre-existing constructs. It's not simply intellectual. It's emotional when is overwhelmed by information the information can be feelings and it's not just facts. But often is feelings are usually feelings and you know, maybe cognitive information. That's just overwhelming the system.\n",
            "Patient: So I have I have a son. So I have I have a sense of how one eventually make sense of facts, but do you feel like one makes sense of emotions in the same way over time? Is there a different set of contracts or tools are features about oneself that allow him to process emotional or emotions feelings?\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know how to answer that off the bat. What do you think? It sounds like you had some thoughts behind at in terms of just even constructing a the question as you did.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I have the experience of Ozzy were talking about it. You know you were talking about it and it made good sense. Then he sort of sad but also not intellectually, you know, it's not just facts. It's also feelings. Yeah, of course, but I have much less clear sense of how do you sort out feelings? Yeah, and I guess one of the ways that I do that is I reject them into the fox say so but I recognized we talked and that in a sense identifies and tags feelings and particular Trends in my feelings. Any monitor those when they're happening that allows me to continue to experience them as feelings, but also recognized that's part of a repeated thing in common in some sense. This is I feel like things are ruined. It's okay. They are not ruined. They not only they are ruined they're probably not very damaged and at this point things are still likely to get very salvageable. That's you know, some line like that is sufficient to Get into the space where I can where I have sufficient agency do think so.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, I guess then my answer to that after hearing you're saying is that I don't think of facts and feelings as a sort of having separate structures, but their links their Associated so I mean there's facts stick out because there are feelings touchless facts and so by processing the fox you can also be processing the feelings because about thought of things aren't ruined has a feeling Association to it much more pleasant than The fax things are ruined.\n",
            "Patient: Sure. Sure. Yeah this point I'm just sort of curious and that I've sort of described a way that I process feelings. It's certainly not the only one I don't think but it's very important in that kind of Time. How do other people process feelings?\n",
            "Doctor: What's my name? I don't know how to answer that question. It's so broad. I would say that you're giving an example of one way you process feelings. You probably process feelings a lot of different ways. That's not the only way you process it. But that was an elegant example of one way of processing them. So when you say other people probability probably the way other people process that you process them to But it would be hard for me to articulate that leavensworth comes to mind at the moment. I'm with my\n",
            "Patient: What do you do while I'm thinking over here?\n",
            "Doctor: do in terms of what do I think about?\n",
            "Patient: I you don't have to think about anything. I was that particular formulation of the questions opposes an answer. And so but I really meant what do you do do you think about other things as a you know anything or because there's a real sense in which like I am engaged in something else. I have no idea what you're doing.\n",
            "Doctor: So this is not a question to invade that question, but I'm serious about this. Do you think about and other situations as well when you're with other people or is it just we tend to not beat we're not exactly. Interactive in a weigh-in at moments. It's in that makes what makes you here it is. In the way that it could be less likely in order another social situations for that to happen.\n",
            "Patient: You know, I didn't think it that there is an element in which it's like it's a particular feature of like we are here having a conversation and I think about something else for a while, but that's a that's a feature of a meeting soften one person is usually stalking. Usually there's lots of other people who are not talking so they're doing something it's also a feature of like dinner with more than one person. So and I do Wonder like what other people are thinking about my other contacts also, but sometimes I have a clear sense of what they're doing and I do here so like in a lot of meetings I know which of my colleagues Are spending most of the time on their phone because they really don't want to be in the meeting and we're hardly engaged when they were looking at him. So I don't ask them like what they were doing because I know if that makes sense.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, that's yeah, I have two different thoughts. My first thought is direct answer is I see what happens not just like what happened between us I see what happens in me where my mind goes I'm feeling and then try As it happens to reflect on what could be what that could be about but some I guess then doing two things. I'm both trying to tell something evolved inside me. And then also try to think about that at the same time. Sometimes I'm doing more than more of one than the other which is why in situations. I have a lot of things to say because I'm not thinking very much about what's going on. Sometimes I'm letting things. I don't know Ashley have any words for it. But so I don't have anything to say I just don't want to talk for the sake of talking. But so that that was one thought is a direct answer. But the other I had is we talked about it all along we talked about it today, but it's sometimes sort of similar to the foreground of just sort of acutely aware and sensitive you are about with the people. You're around your very end in on them.\n",
            "Patient: Yes to the last part. I have not a lot to say there but I think that's probably the place we should the thing we should talk about. But thank you for the direct answer. Also, that was very interesting in it very much matches my experience of like how you interact with me, you know, you often say something like this came to my mind, which is entirely consistent with what you just said that is you know, so thanks for sharing. I appreciate now what's going on?\n",
            "Doctor: I do we're going to need to stop James but I do I do agree that this is sort of the sensitivity you have, you know, this is sort of acute sensitivity. This is to talk about and to think about together, but there's a lot there, but we do not need to stop for today. So I'll see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: Alright. Thank you.\n",

            "Doctor: Hi.\n",
            "Patient: Good morning. I woke up 10 minutes before my alarm went off this morning, which I always sort of like but sort of hate because I'd like to sleep that extra 10 minutes. James is not doing so well. I don't really know what he like went out for a walk last night late and got back later. And I said, is there anything I can do and he said probably not and then that was that there's isn't anything I can do. I don't know where to start. I don't know whether like I don't know whether at any given moment. I don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing or the wrong thing and whether I'm helping him or hurting him. It's like anything I do. I feel like we just don't trust each other right now. We were watching Lewis. We watch it like Tuesday's less than a week. It's only 20 minutes episodes. There was an episode last night of a guy who's a very old friend of Lewis comes into town and basically takes Louis out and then tells him he's going to kill himself until like we saw it was about suicide like on the blur James was like I'm so we didn't watch it one night. Then the next night. It was like do you want to skip it and he was like, what about you I'm fine and I was like, but let's watch it. It wasn't very it just wasn't great. I don't know. It just didn't go anywhere and it didn't feel inauthentic to me. I just felt like the show's writers. Didn't know what they were trying to say. I don't know. I mean, it's like I don't really know because I can't talk to him about it. I feel like James is just afraid that he's going to come back one day and I will have killed myself, but you know, I can see why one would not trust me to give in that and I can't promise him that I won't I'm trying but I We went out for a drink after church. I guess two weeks ago. Now are we going to have with the regulars from church and at the very end of the evening, everyone was like like an hour at the very end of the conversation. One of them was like a psychologist. I think his ordained in the church also, but I'm considering him a psychologist somehow by calling like getting calls from him like emergency calls from his patient came up. I'm like what he said was like well if they're calling me they don't want to die, but they're still suicidal and everyone was like, huh? Yeah, but I don't want to say anything. I'm not quite sure why I thought of that this was the same to evening wear another of the people. I was hanging out with worked at Frederick. So it was kind of a weird evening in that. I don't know fortunately nobody was that interested in listening to me. Like I was part of the conversation, but nobody was relying on you to lead it. It was easier than it might have been I didn't have to take a stand or anyting. Yeah, it could have been much more comfortable than it was. I think I'm doing better but it doesn't seem fair to you to make promises like that.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm wondering if one reason it's difficult to talk about it is because it feels like something that I get maybe a little bit more or an easier to talk to you about it then James and that is not uncomfortable.\n",
            "Patient: I can't I don't like remember not being able to talk to James about something like that was important in my life before I just never Even like Falling In Love With Another Man was something I could talk to James about. It's like I'm really used to thinking that most things are my fault. So it's like I don't even notice it anymore. It's just like a baseline assumption until like I start thinking that things would just be better if I were part of the equation, but that's exactly the problem right now. Like the fact that I think that is what what is problematic. I don't know if that makes sense. So driving into one of the events. I think it was like the brunch on Sunday because it was the one that got heated. I remember just sitting there very clearly and thinking this is because of something I did. This is my fault and like I think I remember that most I think I remember that most because it was so clear that it was really not my fault at all. Like it was not anything I did or anything I could have done to prevent it. So yeah fairly self-centered. I feel like James is having a rough time and maybe it's because of me maybe it's not but I feel like it must not it must be because of me and it is incumbent on me to fix unlike. I know those things aren't true, but I just can't handle it.\n",
            "Doctor: I can think that it's embarrassing to ask what I think because it's hard to imagine that I'm not thinking critically of you or maybe you're not being in more control or not being more rational or for even being involved.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess I'm in sort of a double bind where I worried that if I talk about constantly thinking that everything is my fault. You will think that it's very selfish and irrational of her and if I don't talk about it, you will say don't you realize that everything is your fault? so sort of fact I think about this with regard to my depression and how do you categorize depression a mental illness and like implicit? Unclear and people keep telling me it's not my fault. But they also keep telling me that it's my responsibility to change it. So I don't really know. I don't know how those two are in conflict with each other. James keeps telling me that it's not my fault that he's really pissed at me for for it all the same time so I don't I don't know. I don't really remember this but I wrote about it a long time ago. There was a point in the hospital where the Doctor Who had been there basically a long time and all my third or fourth or fifth visit and basically he was like you need to work harder. You just need to work harder to feel better and it was like, I don't know what to do. I can't exactly say they were wrong. If it pissed me off enough that they will what I decided to do at the time was like well fuck it. I'll just get better enough to go home. And then next time I'll just kill myself. That's what I'll do, but then I got better enough to go home and I didn't tell myself. So that was good, but I don't want people start saying but that to me, how do I I just think that well, that's why that's what they've been thinking all this time.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: And I don't know. I don't really have a clear handle on what I'm talking about even here. I'm trying not to forget that.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you're really anxious because you're describing. I think how other people play an important part in putting you in a double bind, but I think kind of offloading blame or mentioning how that pisses you off is pretty terrifying at the moment. I suspect because I'm going to retaliate in some way maybe and even a little concerned that saying what it feels like I'm doing\n",
            "Patient: I don't know if that last is true. I feel like it happens often enough that I will say. I'm angry at this other person and you're going to say well maybe you're also angry at me and I say I don't know and then like right now I'm sort of angry with the mental health care, and I don't know how to say that and not have you interpret that as I'm really angry at you.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I guess I was thinking more like you might feel like I was retaliating by pointing out that you were laying blame on other people and that that would make you feel anxious and guilty and as though I was kind of throwing it back at you in some fashion. If it doesn't feel that way to you. That's great, but I sort of understand.\n",
            "Patient: I don't mean to. I guess I should try harder like that.\n",
            "Doctor: I have the impression that has something to do with my saying that's not how it feels.\n",
            "Patient: No, I think I was. Telling you that I didn't know how to say that as angry as somebody with.\n",
            "Doctor: RC\n",
            "Patient: I was immediately after saying that is when I started to panic.\n",
            "Doctor: I see now. That sounds I feel like you were being like I was going to hear that as you being critical of me.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: something\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder if somewhere it felt like telling me how I was self-centered which it seems to me you're feeling is one of the worst things in the world in a way that sort of third rail for you when you feel like you're being that way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it does feel like one of the worst things in the world. I didn't know think that I felt like that. I have a hard time telling you that I think you're wrong increasingly like that. Well, because I think it's like, you know the longer we work together the more you end up being right? I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I don't like not relying on my own judgment. I feel really uncomfortable with that like saying like I don't see how this is, right, but from experience I should probably sit with it for a while and see it's actually very scary to talk to you about this. I feel like historically when I've trusted other people's judgment over my own it's ended badly for me. And I don't I really don't think that that is what you're asking me to do to be clear. I really don't think that I but there's always somebody asking me to do that.\n",
            "Doctor: There's no if it's worse if you're actually making the decision of whether to do that and how as opposed to my asking you to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah a little bit because then if it ends badly for me, it's like I'm it is very scary Community to let to let me know that I trust you that that much because clearly you're with me like that's just going to happen. So there you have it.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it sort of related to say that the most you let yourself think that this is about you and what's going on with you the more likely you'll be disappointed that it actually becomes about me and what I need.\n",
            "Patient: I don't understand.\n",
            "Doctor: in some way that I'm going to disavow like but in somewhere like our relationship is going to emerge as being like my needs and why is that I'm going to just bow.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I mean, I certainly feel like it's not like it's eventually not going to be okay for it to be about what I need, but I don't know if that's the same thing as what you're saying.\n",
            "Doctor: Does Samia pretty close to what I'm saying? Although I guess when you describe me fucking with me. That makes it sound more deliberate really.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, I just thought this is not going to end well. I guess also the way that our conversations go and we talked for a long time. And this is going on and I sort of say well that makes sense or like no that doesn't feel right. But like I don't know I worry about I just worry about being wrong. And I know that I probably don't need to but I do. And even like do re last or something.\n",
            "Doctor: I think we should finish for today.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: I heard they lost. Sorry about that.\n",
            "Patient: if they won they would have put San Francisco and I would have been in San Francisco for my the Super Bowl instead of at my grandma's 90th birthday party so now\n",
            "Doctor: I guess she'll be there during a Super Bowl.\n",
            "Patient: yeah but they won't be in the Super Bowl so I had a real slap day yesterday just stayed in my PJs and slept on the couch and watch the inauguration all day and I went out to get Chinese food which I threw up this morning\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, no.\n",
            "Patient: Nice. Yeah, which is probably a good thing because I ate too much.\n",
            "Doctor: That's a pretty delayed throwing up. I mean I know you like spit up some phlegm in the morning, but usually don't go throw up like dinner in the morning, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Only when I order Chinese food because I eat too much. So it's still in my stomach, you know, 12 hours later 8 hours later whatever it's happened once before and I woke up yesterday. I had no no nausea whatsoever. So I was a little surprised because I figured I was dehydrated. From drinking but I decided against taking the adderal yesterday because that would have probably motivated me to do something.\n",
            "Doctor: We will wait backup. You decided not to take the Adderall because I had you taken it. You would have felt like getting something done and you didn't want to feel like getting anything done so you didn't take it.\n",
            "Patient: Sort of it's not that I didn't feel like getting anything done. I don't feel like doing anything, you know kids.\n",
            "Doctor: And you were worried you might start to feel like doing something.\n",
            "Patient: If I take the adderal, yeah, you know like I'd go to the office and do something, you know, which I probably should have done. I'm going straight to the office from here. And I had motivated and made that decision before I took the adderal. But I definitely can tell the difference not too long after taking it like right now from how I saw, you know an hour ago.\n",
            "Doctor: Good. I'm glad it's helping it could be really\n",
            "Patient: you know, it's like I'm just like\n",
            "Doctor: different yeah\n",
            "Patient: I might just you know too tired and this is giving me energy or is it really helping my focus and stuff like that? I thought about something that I was able to focus on a little better. I can't remember what it was. I think Ian was bothering me while I was doing what I was trying to do something. I can't remember. I did want to see the kids yesterday though. I was going to text Jess to see if they went and see when they were going to get back, but I never did.\n",
            "Doctor: for the weekend\n",
            "Patient: just for\n",
            "Doctor: for the day\n",
            "Patient: for the day. Yeah and little friend moved cheese. There was call me when I can't take the call you no have to leave a message. And then when I did speak to them, you can't even remember the conversation like nothing was accomplished, you know, so I kind of ended up talking with Jess about what's going to happen with the house and she still suggests that I move into the house and that she take my apartment which now has one less room. I'm like, how are you going to fit in there, you know?\n",
            "Doctor: So, is that your condo?\n",
            "Patient: No, that's their multi-family.\n",
            "Doctor: Where is she now?\n",
            "Patient: Write what she wants to do is because my rents going down to 1200. She's not going to be able to get 1200 rent anywhere that isn't a slumlord or in a bad neighborhood. So she wants my 1200 rent, you know and for me to move into the house that's getting foreclosed on or short stay alert. I don't know why she wants me to move there, you know, but\n",
            "Doctor: Wright's just wants to cover her own ass.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I've been dreading talking about it and it wasn't so bad, you know just about what we were going to do as far as selling, you know, and I said I was going to do something see if they have an investment modification program. Maybe I'll call them today or tomorrow.\n",
            "Doctor: This is the bank.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, just to buy sometime, you know. Makanda litigation is just I'm on all these emails that I can't even read them. They're just so I don't even know what they're talking about. They're arguing over stuff and taking Hot Shots at each other. The disenfranchised trustee is, you know, both trustees gave me. Little bits to what the finances were or at least Riley did the guy who jumps eyes, so she thinks that you should be brought up on perjury charges because he no longer supports the litigation. I don't want to explain to her that you know, you didn't lie in the effect of it. He just doesn't want to enforce it, you know. They really need to either go into some sort of mediation or hire their own lawyers and sit with each other individually. I mean, I have to figure out how to extract myself from the situation. You know, Riley has not been communicating to me about at all about it. He just sent one email said he no longer supports the litigation and of course the email that I wrote out with her with our options likely I didn't talk about our trial strategy, but the disenfranchised women and sub emailing it to the defendant. I'm picking a trial date on Tuesday. We have a closing that morning. Probably not going to be able to meet with you on Tuesday.\n",
            "Doctor: Which Tuesday?\n",
            "Patient: This coming Tuesday the 29th.\n",
            "Doctor: About a week from today.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So we're off.\n",
            "Patient: I know better today, but I think I've got a closing that morning.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Do you want me to send a message later today?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, if I remember but I pick Ian up today. Jess is taking some knitting class or something like that. You know, she complains that she has no time to get work done and she's so overwhelmed and you know, I don't know but taking a knitting class in the middle of the day. She takes all of Friday off with Lucille.\n",
            "Doctor: We every week or\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they've got a class at the school that they go to she's been trying to apply for the preschool program and get what's the word. They have a preschool program. I think they do.\n",
            "Doctor: This one out there.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, trying to get financial aid. Yesterday was interesting because you know, I felt crappy all day, you know, and it wasn't so much bummed about the game. I mean, I'm sure that affected my mood some but just, you know lonely nothing to do just you know, I don't know. And I helped Ian felt his Pinewood car this car that I had no fucking clue what I'm doing went and bought some stickers for it numbers and flames and skulls and stuff like that little decals. He has a bunch of paint but I don't think he has the right paint to it. I don't know paint would I don't know they kind of don't give you a whole lot of Direction, you know. They're just like help you cut it and then they just like, all right, the way it is the way it is, you know, whatever. So there's no okay. She is what you need to do now or anything like that, you know, I don't think it's our Times Leader kind of a scatterbrain.\n",
            "Doctor: You really do the thing where you feel?\n",
            "Patient: There's not a clinical term for it.\n",
            "Doctor: There's some clinical terms.\n",
            "Patient: I just wonder if this thing was official. Jargon or\n",
            "Doctor: You also do this other thing.\n",
            "Patient: back to the first thing. I do sorry for interrupting.\n",
            "Doctor: the second thing\n",
            "Patient: That's part of one of the symptoms of ADD, so\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, but you don't interrupt randomly you enter up specifically what I'm trying to tell you something. I guess. I think that it's funny.\n",
            "Patient: So I do this thing what?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, where you feel you have this fantasy that you're completely helpless.\n",
            "Patient: fantasy\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. Oh my God. I have no freaking clue what I'm doing with the whole Pinewood Derby car. I just they just don't give us much direction to scout leader is kind of scatterbrained. I don't know if we have the paint to paint on the wood if this it's a Saturday 5 days from now, whatever. I mean there's this thing called the internet or people, you know, I mean, you could look it up in 15 minutes short of a detailed instruction if you want about what to do. I'm sure I'll figure out where to buy the paint or you know, you could probably watch a video on YouTube showing you exactly what to do and you don't need me to tell you this like you've used Google and YouTube before and part of you is like, oh my God, I'm completely overwhelmed. I have no idea what to do. I have as responsibilities way over my head when they can't handle it. It's only five days away. I'm going to let my kid down. I'm anxious and Confused. So it's like striking to me. Are you going to ask one of the other patients parents or you could call the scout leader and ask him or her where to look or you could I mean any one of those things would probably work in again? I'm not saying this to you know, I'm so smart. I have all these ideas you could think of this but\n",
            "Patient: It wasn't about my anxiety.\n",
            "Doctor: maybe I mean clearly you are feeling anxious when you are feeling overwhelmed. Absolutely and I sense if your anxiety I don't think you're actually I'm not sure that's really mostly what this is about. Another all questioning how you feel, you know, do you feel overwhelmed you feel anxious do you feel and do you feel helpless? I absolutely believe that you do. I know you're not making that up and I know it's really unpleasant. Absolutely. I'm not sure. Is this like a bid for attention? Do you want somebody to run in and help you out or fix it or make it better and tell you what to do. Is it because you know, if you got instructions then you'd actually feel responsible for doing the car doing a job and somehow that would be normal. I don't know. Is there something else? I'm not sure.\n",
            "Patient: Just kind of something beyond my comfort zone, you know. I don't have really good woodworking or painting or any time of skill that requires making something using a tool\n",
            "Doctor: I guess I sort of think that's the same thing again. I hear what you're saying. You were saying you're sort of like crap C or Carpinteria that way. It's not something that you're comfortable with at the same time. You're smart. You're a smart confident guy. You can probably get pretty good instructions is a fucking Pinewood Derby car. You know what I mean? I don't know if that's what you have. No, I don't know if that you have no confidence. You know, I guess I refuse to believe you don't have the like you're not so smart never stole enough to my get in there and give it a try and have it turn it adequate. You know, I'm sure Ian is probably excited about how it looks when it turns out he feels mostly excited. Just doing it with you, you know, and I'm sure if you like good instructions. Thought about it a little bit. I mean 20 minutes or something before you get. And worked with him on it that you know, you could do more than adequate job. Maybe it would be the best one there or the fastest one or the best-looking one, but it would probably be fine. I guess it doesn't feel like that.\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: I imagine you have the sort of idea that you're just\n",
            "Patient: I made one when I was a kid, but I remember nothing about making it other than I won the silliest Car funniest car. I made like a Datsun, you know, I don't even remember why it was so funny and wants to win the silliest car, but we're not making a silly car. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I think you could do a fine job if you spent, you know, 20 or 30 minutes on Google and YouTube.\n",
            "Patient: When am I going to do that?\n",
            "Doctor: maybe took a trip to like\n",
            "Patient: Michaels\n",
            "Doctor: Sure, Michaels.\n",
            "Patient: they have a whole pile derby stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Shirt that sounds ideal then it's mostly about spending time with the kids doing something together. Maybe you guys will turn out something fine was involved. Did they give you like the parts of a cars and you have to put together or\n",
            "Patient: To give you a block and some Wheels.\n",
            "Doctor: and you have to like you sauce and\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they had a bandsaw Junior template on the car and they cut it. We actually have to add pieces of wood to the top to make it. You know, which is the part. I'm really more concerned about is, you know, making it look like a bumper car, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: So what do you need to add to the top?\n",
            "Patient: Just like the front Shield, you know, it has it kind of goes up a little bit and then there's like a back part, you know, just kind of a little it has to be built up a little bit.\n",
            "Doctor: ICCU have Like a car with no front back when shields and you need and you kind of need to put those on there.\n",
            "Patient: Write a lot of the cars are race cars where you go down and you know where this is your building it up.\n",
            "Doctor: I see that something that has to be wood or can you get it get like\n",
            "Patient: well, I don't want\n",
            "Doctor: Michael's nails and pieces in a piece of tape in like just or maybe three nails like boom boom boom. And then you put a piece of tape. That's the windshield kind of around the nails and then like, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Then you can even get a Sharpie and you could like draw the windshield wipers.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm horrible at this stuff so I can pick me up the easiest least Talent way to do it because that's about what I would be up to.\n",
            "Patient: If only it was a girl.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you get up to this?\n",
            "Patient: Well, we'll find out.\n",
            "Doctor: I think the main thing that gets in your way is that you're afraid to give it a try. So you kind of overweight it and feel helpless and then when you get there and you haven't thought about it at all and you're kind of freaking out a little bit, you know, then it does make things more difficult. Pull it off. What do you think?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I mean it's just you know.\n",
            "Doctor: What?\n",
            "Patient: What? What?\n",
            "Doctor: You said you know.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I was thinking about something else.\n",
            "Doctor: What was that? Cameron I don't think you have enough self confidence in yourself when it comes to a lot of things.\n",
            "Patient: We already knew that how does that explain why I have a ton of laundry that I needed to do 2 weeks ago.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you feel kind of crummy about yourself as a result in part of your lack of confidence. And you know, when you're feeling call me about yourself. It can be hard to be motivated and take care of yourself. You still down and you don't feel like you're worth it. You don't do your laundry.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. When do the bathroom Chinese food? Yesterday was Blue Monday the most depressing day of the year my whole life or something it was. the things that will happen, I don't have I don't know. I just don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: next Tuesday\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I just have to confirm that the closing Tuesday, which I think it is.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: Good morning. So I can't remember it was last time we met that you gave me two pieces of advice. I don't remember if it was a vice over two sessions, but you the first one was you suggested that I was going to be? Okay in one of two ways that is very helpful. And the other was that you suggested that you thought it would be that you would wish for me that I not that I accept things as not ideal, but also good or evil to do that in general. So I've been. Trying to Both on certainly the first kind of ring true II also Rings true for a lot of reasons in a lot of situations. I got somewhere by so many pieces of Weiser last I guess lost ball sort of said we should just write up what you haven't talked in. It won't be the pieces that I always really wanted, but it will be good enough. So it's the specific version of the same advice. I think but not ideal but it's still so Both pieces of been very helpful since then. I think I told you good luck when you said you wanted me to change the way I was approaching the world, but I've been trying just that was the recognition that would be difficult thing. So the first piece that was always helpful particularly in dealing with the violation of tonya's mood so not to use the word scientific but was Common Sense there's a lot of fluctuations in her mood on a short timescale and he suggested months ago that I not track her mood day today, but there's a glitch that's fundamentally impossible when I'm there and not paying attention to how her mood is at any given moment. But having in some sense of a clearer sense of there's a future that will end up. Make something unimportant. Or not it makes it only importantly an immediate context. So it's easier to deal with her or something.\n",
            "Doctor: But there's a difference between being oblivious to her mood and not attaching significance to it every day.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that is so it's yeah, I mean, I'm not going to be able to not pay attention to it, but it's just isn't really feasible. I guess you're saying that not what you're suggesting anyway, but I don't think I've ever really took you to be saying that just so much as not projecting a trend off of it at any given moment. So the second piece has been very pain helpful. No idea but still good still okay has been helpful in dealing with the variety of situations as I guess you might imagine it would be which is why you suggested it. So I'm working to apply for a postdoc position now and I was at the time finishing up a poster and taking it to a conference and spending time at the conference helicopter in relationship with conferences and other academic things in that I hold them to that ideal but they're never ideal. That's the but never going to be that's okay. They're still good. Although parts of them are not good and it's so it's so I give the poster on two different nights. I gave them a Monday and Wednesday night. The Monday night was supposed to be like a big Gathering of all the different areas that make up society and it's supposed to be some sort of privilege to present there, but it turns But no one actually cares what you've done at the session because no one has the expertise or background of knowledge. So they looks at what you say. Oh, no, that's nice, and then they kind of move on so it's not ideal and if it's good, it's barely good. Wednesday night 1 Wednesday night was very different. I had to talk with variety of experts in the sub areas of my area of biomechanics about the things that I had done. That was fun interesting debt for everyone. So maybe it was an ideal either but it was still very good. So it's kind of I don't know I pressed you a little bit when you first talked about it. About well, so you want me to get rid of this idea, but not ideal equals not good. But I'm trying to argue also for the category that it's not good between those two something like that. So anyway, so I think it's been hold hold both to appreciate what I'm doing two and two separate. What is good from what is not good in actual sense as opposed to like cuz easy thing to say is that Monday night post session was an idea but it also wasn't but it was just a crappy post-recession, but that's okay because that's two hours of my life. Not a big deal.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not encouraging obliterating categories and having everything be in the good category.\n",
            "Patient: I don't really take you to me, but I think you're pushing pretty hard knot on the not ideal part. Not ideal does not equal good not good in part because you sense resistance. It's also been helpful and actually getting the work done to send out these applications because they're not going to be ideal either, but I can still write a good application and its again this morning to not elaborate categories. Because I could write an application. That would not yet read but I could write an application. That would probably be red and we'll be as good as I can do. And like I said, just as good as I can do, so, it should be enough. I can't really do more by definition. So, thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: My pleasure.\n",
            "Patient: That's not saying it's like trivial in that all of my problems are solved by this one in sight, but it's very helpful. I'm trying to use it.\n",
            "Doctor: How are you feeling that Tanya's are volatile or if they're just as volatile as they've always been.\n",
            "Patient: The news are still somewhat fragile in that shoot. She has good moods now, which is good and has good days, but relatively small setbacks. I can't think of an example off hand what can be a larger impact on her than they would if she were healthier whatever exactly that word means and then they had at previous times that our life. She's been getting more involved in her church, which is good spending time around people like being involved in the community. I think it's a really good other side just barely drained from the not really related to violating that sense that it's like everything's harder for you her then. It would be under arbitrary Harrison circumstances that wasn't 6 months ago. So So we've been spending making dinner. So the nights that she's working I make dinner and the other night. She makes dinner the process of figuring out what to make for dinner seems to overwhelm her some days not Ashley doing it, but like having to make a decision about where we would eat so I'm not really sure if I answered the question. What does those are the thoughts I had.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I was asking just about your term of volatility.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I meant that in the same markets are bile violate which has nothing to do with the chemical definitions which goes in to the gas phase. Usually it has to do with popular definition where some say says it's about Violet and you think of it as\n",
            "Doctor: Unpredictable is usually the reference.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but why what compound is a very predictable thing going into the gas phase at it's vapor pressure this temperature. Anyways, sorry, it's not really the point. But Herman does not always always has not truly unpredicted because I guess I've told you sort of several cause and effect type things. I guess how large the effect of any specific is difficult to predict. And everyday sort of like she gets up and it's a reset as whether it will be a good day or a bad day sing arbitrary. So that part is unpredictable.\n",
            "Doctor: You're looking intently.\n",
            "Patient: I didn't mean to be yeah, I guess I'm curious as to whether you're going to let us sit in silence for a long time or whether you had another question.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. It was just up to me whether I let us sit in silence.\n",
            "Patient: It's not. It's not.\n",
            "Doctor: but\n",
            "Patient: but I sort of Said the things that I had prepared to say in some sense, I don't have a follow-up to those things. Those were pieces that I thought it was important to bring up. It's all I have and then I'm not really sure what else to say. So often when I talk for as long as I have you have other You're curious about things.\n",
            "Doctor: well, I'm curious about a lot of things but Sometimes I like to sort of just see where your mind goes.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: What it seems like something is in your thoughts. What are you thinking?\n",
            "Patient: turned into a game sort of but I'm not sure what\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, no.\n",
            "Patient: not a bad way just in a funny way. You're sort of say yeah. Well, I'm curious as to what your thoughts are. So I'll just wait for you to share them and I'm saying well, I'm kind of curious as to what you're curious about. So I'll just wait.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: And so it's a game.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not meaning to set it up as part of a octagonal scheme or anything, but that looks like how is it involving? I was amused.\n",
            "Doctor: It's like who will speak first?\n",
            "Patient: Something like that. Yeah, and now it's lost we can't even sit in silence for long. So Tanya and I were doing couples counseling but we stopped going to see him.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you not like him or did you not want to be in couples counseling?\n",
            "Patient: Little bit of both the first session. I think we both felt a little bit like he wasn't here in this. Well, we'd have to explain things went with Waze and then he would respond and he would explain it about four or five times and almost the same way this sort of response, which is clearly not how I felt interacting with you and it's not how you spell interacting with Chad. We're both relatively comfortable in those relationships. But not that other one has to confirm the specifications. But so we went back to the second session and I felt familiar, but that wasn't really the breaking point. So there's sort of about 70% of the way through where he was sort of started pressing Tanya to say what she felt like she was okay and wasn't going to kill herself because that's what he had heard from her previous session. She thought she had really said that but he's had sort of like I've seen some people try to talk to her and more private assessment in her situation, and she then she agreed with and news kind of okay the first night the second night. She was doing worse cuz of Thursday night. She works Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday 10 hours a day and so by Thursday night. It's not really she's a little more crap from them and I would say he was kind of pressing the Question and she wasn't very happy about it. So I suggested to him that he didn't really want to talk about the issue because I've known her for a long time and I can sort of particularly when she's interacting with somebody. I can really tell a good sense of her Moon. She kind of I didn't apparently didn't raise it very strong, but it didn't seem to him. And kind of kept pressing the question until she just said I don't want to talk about this anymore. And which there was an awkward silence in a firm denial comes with. There's a distress about the circumstances causes and her is not helpful for either of us. so that was a large part of not going back if that I mean, I don't know how you feel in response to that but\n",
            "Doctor: bad\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Okay, like we did the wrong thing or was that a bad situation?\n",
            "Doctor: no, I feel bad because I know him less than I actually I have someone now. I don't know if you want to try someone else. There are a few people. I really want to refer you guys too, or just booked.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: I know him less. He came on the recommendation of someone. I really trust you can be very good. Just not a good match for you. I don't like what I'm hearing. I don't like that. It sounds like maybe this is you are concerned with something different than mine your it's sounding like there were two concerns one is that he wanted to talk about something that you guys didn't want to talk about particularly Tanya II the things that concerns me more and maybe this isn't even intended is that he was pushing for a particular answer that may not have been true. That's more concerning to me. I mean not to say that you should be forced to talk about things. You don't want to talk about but you certainly shouldn't feel that you can't be honest.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Yeah that honestly just isn't heard which I feel like Tanya was trying to say no that's not really good description of it. He was kind of trying to push her towards this particular description. And yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's why I feel bad because I referred you to someone and it didn't sound like he did right by you.\n",
            "Patient: Well, thank you. I'm not upset with you. So just a thank you. Yeah, I think we would like another recommendation from you. But so that it gets to the other part of your question. Which was you do you just not want to be a couple counseling the answer to that is that I think couples counseling can and with the right person will help us but old certainly if we're going to be okay we're going to do that and then couples counseling is a particular venue to do certain things and certain insights and to be together and that was actually very helpful experience in the sense of uniting us against a third party. So it wasn't all bad in a lot of ways. It was like we became closer to that experience. If that makes sense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: How are you?\n",
            "Patient: Right now, I'm great.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I'm glad to hear that.\n",
            "Patient: It's been a terrible week. Well, I'm not a terrible weeks sleep wise, but it sounded very good week. I've made me go running this morning with the dogs. So I feel pretty good right now.\n",
            "Doctor: But he thought you feel better.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I've kind of been wallowing this week. We didn't get great news from the doctor my friend left. He had a bad shock with his mom. I was just kind of sucked into such an incredible week.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like you did really have a hard week.\n",
            "Patient: Can you keep having things that felt like they were going to get me out of it? Like I gave a talk at school and I was really fun and I got really pumped and then I came home and we are supposed to take his mom up for dinner and he had tried to go out to Staples by himself and like so like he was out of control walking so that kind of killed it everyday. I felt like I was going to do a push through something would happen and I just couldn't cope. It's funny though. I didn't feel anxious or have trouble sleeping. I just kind of felt depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: We had some bad sad things happen. I know you are upset about your friend leaving and that actually had to face this week. And you said he had a difficult talk with his mom and you got just got news from the doctor. So those are all pretty sad things respond to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was just funny because it didn't make me stuck and I pretty much just kind of made me not want to do anything.\n",
            "Doctor: You were sad.\n",
            "Patient: I slept.\n",
            "Doctor: You are sad.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, I slept more and his mom had brought me like six chocolate bars for Christmas and I ate chocolate and while which is not the best.\n",
            "Doctor: Well for a short time is pretty appropriate.\n",
            "Patient: I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: This all happened this week. So if you're you wallowed for 2 weeks and then I'd say well it's starting to look like depression because it's stuck around for so long but sticking around for most of the week is still considered within normal range for reacting to sad news and difficult things.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I'm a little run this morning. I decided it's better than what could have happened last year and I think it has mostly because Josh was a reason. I wouldn't say he's happy but he's not miserable. He's kind of acting choppy or guy. I asked him why he was so happy. Yeah, and he said I don't know because I think he's got more perspective. I don't know. He just seems happier.\n",
            "Doctor: So what happened in the appointment? What did you hear and learn?\n",
            "Patient: Well, so he got cardioverted on Tuesday, and they said that his heart was like four times the size. It's supposed to be which renew but it basically hasn't gone down at all. And if I had come down then there would be like hope so that's kind of not much. Hope that that will continue to happen.\n",
            "Doctor: You're saying that they're not believing that what they will do what kind of allowed to drink again, but it's going to stay in March.\n",
            "Patient: Probably out of the doctor said it's one of the biggest party scene. He said he probably has a genetically large heart. He's an athlete which makes your heart really sick. So there was extra stuff to stretch out or something all kinds of unlucky think so and then they put them on he got really badly and not really badly burned but they gave him a lot of electricity this time and he got a really bad burn and they kept him a couple of nights like he couldn't sleep because he has a giant on his back. And in fact, I don't know what exactly is going on. He's been acting so funny this beat the second day after he came out of the hospital. We were driving home from the pharmacy or something and he was like, I want your parents to come over if you call them up and have them come visit. I was shocked. I was like really you're actually asking people to come hang out. So I called my parents up and they came over the next day and he made them all sooner. So that was really good so I can spend Emma helped me a lot despite the fact that I was still vomiting. So, I don't know what's really good.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it sounds like it is.\n",
            "Patient: So we were kind of Designing. It's much better than it could have been now after dragged out of my wall away. My friend has been like just sending us emails about her new life all week and how wonderful and easy does Linnaeus pictures and I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What's that like to get those?\n",
            "Patient: I'm so jealous of her. I mean I did that for three four five years ago, and it's so exciting and full of Dreams full of energy at just going going damn. I was extra bummed out because she was with us long enough that she witnessed. I think a few days before she left Josh. I don't know what he did took too many drugs and eat enough, whatever. He got really nauseous and nearly puking in the bathroom for a few hours and you know, she saw that she's all set to know enough to see before and I told her most of the things that there were to tell. Her and she responded unlike anyone else has like, you know you and I talked to her unlike Josh who we talked about most things how I feel and how he feels probably more about how I feel it's always go and like extra stuff that comes along with the conversation, but I don't know she just completely understood whatever I was saying and still seem to think that we were amazing and wonderful people and had a great life. So that was that has that was has disappeared.\n",
            "Doctor: It's hard to have that gone.\n",
            "Patient: And the day we took her to the airport. We took her I like 5 in the morning and we didn't get much sleep and I figured I'd just get you no have a day is started really early and I was destroyed all day. I don't know if it was the exhaustion.\n",
            "Doctor: Taking her the leaving.\n",
            "Patient: It was sad. He I was just a terrible day and then at night Josh had a talk with his mom and it was a really painful conversation to listen to I'm not sure he didn't even talk to me about it. He was like, I'm going to go talk to her right now.\n",
            "Doctor: You know what he wish things you dress with her.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I heard it the whole thing. It was awful and I was thinking I should go over there until he started sort of talking about me kind of in a sideways way. I mean he is a terrible at talking about something like that. His mom is ten times worse. The conversation was one of the most painful thing I have ever listened to and I'm not sure anything came out of him.\n",
            "Doctor: That's too bad.\n",
            "Patient: I mean it didn't end badly it just kind of ended uncomfortable.\n",
            "Doctor: How did Josh feel about it?\n",
            "Patient: Immediately came and asked me if she had gone. On a good job. Like I don't know the two of you may have said something without meanings you like. Are you my computer jumped we may have had said something to that meaning to like I want you to be taken care of when you're old and not be a burden kind of like I don't want your problems some sort of two things and he try to fix it. But I ended up asking her if she wanted us to take her out for dinner a few days later for her birthday, and she clearly was like, I don't know if she was offended by that conversation but said, oh no, no, no. No, you don't have to do that. And then he likes said he didn't actually take her out for his birthday.\n",
            "Doctor: There are things that have happened at the same time.\n",
            "Patient: We didn't take her out because she like could even walk to Staples.\n",
            "Doctor: clear controller has\n",
            "Patient: And she still barely shows any concern about it, and it's just a mess. So anyway, I couldn't handle all week.\n",
            "Doctor: that's awful lot to try to handle in one week. You had a lot thrown at you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they also they gave him an extra drugs to lower his heart rate even more and if it goes blowing up, there is like a built-in Peacemaker that your heart will kick in and he kind of has it naturally because his heart rate is so low, they call it become junctional rhythm. And he woke up in the middle of the night feeling like he had just been shocked the second night. And that was really scary and didn't call the doctor and I was like, oh my gosh take less drugs. So and again no, but I think about it. He's been dealing with it fairly. Well, I just kind of I got a haven't been too rough on him been bummed out about it all I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like he's got some sort of perspective that you haven't had yet. Maybe it's different to be the patient versus one watching the patient your positions with regards to all this I think part of what's hard for you is you have a choice and he doesn't and sometimes it's harder to be the one with the responsibility of making a choice. You can choose whether or not you want to stay with him and watch this unfold figure out what it means for your life. He doesn't have the burden of making that face. You just have to cope with it which isn't a good place to be either but in some ways it's a little bit easier because there's no he has no choice but to cup\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I don't know what what happened to those feelings of wanting to run away. I don't feel like that what is really confusing? We also my friend other doctors appointment and which I asked him and this is not the doctor who did all the procedures. This is a regular radiologist who gives him mostly medication and so he's not the person to ask but he said that in his opinion if this does not hold then there's really nothing more to do so just deal with it.\n",
            "Doctor: is this like eventual transport transplant or is that\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. They pushed the pacemaker before it didn't bring it up yesterday. Maybe he just didn't want to go there. I don't know Josh I talkin to him about stem cell trials and I thought he was kind of out there but the doctor was like sure I don't know. I mean it won't kill him yet right now. He's still healthy and strong enough that it won't kill him unless he has an extreme truck or something.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that more likely is that the risk factor for him?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's a big rest, but that's what he take some of the medication that he takes. Yeah, it's manageable for.\n",
            "Doctor: What is the foreseeable future is that 10 years 20 years a decade? What is that?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I mean the doctor going to answer those questions. I'll have to see the other.\n",
            "Doctor: surgeon\n",
            "Patient: The surgeon he can tell us more than yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: you want to have answers of what the future would hold?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean it really feels I feel terrible that I really go out like this. This is hard and Josh seems to be in a better place about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, but you don't get to the same place at the same time. It sounds like you didn't anger him that you weren't exactly where he was and that your reaction was different.\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't know why he's not as affected by me. I mean, I've also just been pressured this whole week that my friend leaving and him being in the hospital even a happy mood. I mean, it's just like I can't keep myself together. I don't know. I don't know what it is. It just frustrates me constantly, like giving this talk and having my lab really supportive who I gave the talk to you and you know, I even had somebody come in and asked me if I wanted to before I was just really really supported of it. I was just like jazz crazy Jazz and how he was sorry that he is. I don't know anyone else who gave a talk my friends think I'm nuts my lab mates, but\n",
            "Doctor: It's nice that you like what you do.\n",
            "Patient: Well speaking in front of people at school. I get Jazz for men.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not a bad thing.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah in a room full of people like laugh because I said something silly and I'm just like I get so happy then after I started thinking about how this is a problem in my personality and I wish it wasn't this way because some people are sad I get depressed or sick.\n",
            "Doctor: What sounds like you have extreme reactions?\n",
            "Patient: Sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: There's no need to apologize for your feelings. You have strong feelings. You get really pumped when there's something to get up for it and you get a good reaction and it sounds like you had a good talk and you get really sad when there's something that's just part of who you are and it's okay.\n",
            "Patient: It makes me feel crazy.\n",
            "Doctor: It doesn't seem crazy from where I said, I wonder why it feels not okay for you to have these highs and lows.\n",
            "Patient: I don't need other people to drag me out of it.\n",
            "Doctor: I'll run.\n",
            "Patient: Well, if someone making me go.\n",
            "Doctor: So you felt like you could be the one to be responsible for knowing when the limit was like when it had been enough days of Halloween and now it's time to go out for that run that was feeling okay.\n",
            "Patient: I used to be able to do that. I used to be much better at pulling myself together. I was in control of everything because I don't have a boyfriend or dogs or crazy boyfriends mother. Whatever.\n",
            "Doctor: My crazy heart conditions you didn't have that stuff to manage.\n",
            "Patient: Or family or anything, but I'm sure if I was alone again, it's gone now. It's been ruined so which is why I was so jealous of my friend who she's got\n",
            "Doctor: She's doing what you did back when you felt like everything was really under your control.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I hope that she never loses that I hope that she keeps it forever.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I mean in a way it's like your innocence has been shattered.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean if I say stuff like this to Josh and he just tells me I'm being silly and you know, we could be in a much worse places. But again, I told him that doesn't help me and it makes me feel worse that I have feelings like this at all when people are having some kind of hard or something.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like one of the parts of what makes it hard is not just individually what you're facing but that up until all of this stuff existed in your world. You were able to believe this illusion that things were under your control because you hadn't yet come up against something that you couldn't.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: And I don't think that it's that you've actually lost an ability to control everything. I think it's that now there's stuff that's not controllable.\n",
            "Patient: directions to tell me that you can't really succeed as an athlete unless you've had a rough childhood and learn to overcome difficulties. I used to get so mad. Maybe it's true. Maybe you need to have something terrible happened to you when you're younger and you can cope and maybe a truancy more. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What seems like having overcome something like you saying give you practice at kind of getting back up again being or selling it? I don't think it's the only way to learn that being resilient is definitely a piece of being an athlete.\n",
            "Patient: Not at all. Well his\n",
            "Doctor: You're learning it.\n",
            "Patient: never there's more cost learning it now than there would have been.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you're very aware of all the cost.\n",
            "Patient: In high school and you know, I have to keep my life going unless I go back to my parents house and live in their basement. No.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you have a lot of responsibilities than and then\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean I could have more so just as idea of why I needed to have a bad childhood to be happy is that you can push through suffering and suffer a speed cyclist. They say if you stop her for hours and hours and hours. It was just a New York Times article about athletes you get really really injured and thrown out of their spa and how it ruins their lives. I think Josh was actually really happy or even was it yesterday.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's validating for him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Well, I mean really bad injury is like you're paralyzed or something. They have no more friends. Their friends are all still in Spore and don't want to be around them because it reminds them what could happen to them and so on and so forth It's really was depressing. There was no good ending to any of the stories five or six of them couldn't I couldn't keep reading it. I mean there were several stories of cyclist who have died of heart problems, mostly because of drugs and doping when their hearts explode or something, which is awful.\n",
            "Doctor: You found some solace in seeing other people.\n",
            "Patient: I think you fell validated yet\n",
            "Doctor: This is an experience that a lot of people can't empathize with because they hadn't had their world revolve around Sports and their fellow athletes in a way that he did and professional athletes do so be able to read stories of people who are experiencing what he's experienced and not being able to connect to the world and connect to people on the way that he always had relied upon.\n",
            "Patient: yeah and I guess that's why I'm so happy about cheese I mean you let this girl in to see what was going on and I don't know what it is about my family that he feels so comforted by\n",
            "Doctor: And he really does feel comfortable with them.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's really nice. So maybe he is trying to corner. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: He's finding a new way of kind of fit in.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, if you could get it friends. If I could get a friend another one.\n",
            "Doctor: You can give yourself a little bit of time. You're not losing your friend because she moved but she's kind of going to be a part of your life in a different way. You can still be a great friend. She can still listen and understand the way she does she did when she was here. You need someone to go do stuff with somebody else to meet for a run or walk with your dogs or\n",
            "Patient: Anything? Yeah, I mean, it's also talk like you find such a Solas in my family that can drive me nuts. We are going to visit them a week ago with my friend. Also my dad. He's done this a few times like you was telling my friends LP about how hard it is to watch his kids how relationships and how scary it is and how terrifying it is for him as a father and you know, he's around the other side of me from her. This is like when he told my friend did I ever tell you about this? You told my friend that he thought that Josh was going to die last year when we were out to dinner.\n",
            "Doctor: No, no.\n",
            "Patient: Last January I was having a horrible time. I may have just before or just after having run away for some. Of time. I don't know exactly but I force myself to go meet my parents and a friend of mine for dinner and I think it was right after Josh's. Appalachian first one so he was in bad shape. I was in terrible shape and he said to my friend next to me that you know, she was worried that Josh was going to die.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is everyone's worried, right?\n",
            "Patient: Didn't say it to me or talk to me about it you guys to my friend and then my friend was like freaking out to me on the way home asking me why you would say that to her and how upsetting it was so then he base we did a similar thing recently. And I know he's not terrified about my brother's relationship. There's nothing terrifying about that. I mean maybe he thinks about it, but the only one not terrified of relationships, so\n",
            "Doctor: We can't tell you about it.\n",
            "Patient: No, he can't talk to me about it at all. Not at all.\n",
            "Doctor: What's it like for you to know that he scared of that?\n",
            "Patient: It's terrible. It's awful. I'd like him to be supportive and he could tell me that he's like worried but\n",
            "Doctor: Tara feels a little strong.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean it basically implies that he does not want me to be doing this which is fine if he talks to me about it. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I could have died that we're could imply that he's worried for you. But accept a relationship for what it is. It would be nice for all of you for you for Josh for your dad. If there wasn't this looming question of what was help you like and he thinks that is pretty pretty terrifying. You never know what's going to happen for anyone but it would be nice to be able to live under the assumption that things are going to be easier than the assumption that you're under.\n",
            "Patient: Yep.\n",
            "Doctor: Even if it's not a correct or something, it's nice to be able to think about.\n",
            "Patient: I keep waiting.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and believing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, Josh, when he had the procedure done before and after she is so anxious. I mean, he stares at the monitor just waiting for a Star to go with them which is reasonable because sometimes it does, you know, you wouldn't eat anything after he got his last procedure done just in case he went out of prison so that he could do it again just in case and this can't be though.\n",
            "Doctor: For how long do you do that?\n",
            "Patient: We need to keep in there for like an hour or so. I can't be good for your recovery or anything. I keep teasing her about how we both should go to meditation and I'm kind of wondering if we really should because this week he hasn't been walking around staring at his heart looking depressed. I'm not sure why exactly actually but he gets into a. Of doing that.\n",
            "Doctor: Well meditation shirt certainly wouldn't hurt. You know, when we do the breathing exercise in the mindfulness. That's a type of meditation the same family and it does give you at least a brief moment of respite from your worries and sometimes, you know getting a little break from what it is what you need. It doesn't necessarily change a whole day of what you're feeling. It gives you a break from it for the regular practice of meditation, you know, a lot of people do get more standing benefit of decrease anxiety increase acceptance.\n",
            "Patient: Is he? Yeah, actually he is it's hard to think about how we could actually do it in our crate are crazy house and what would actually need to happen?\n",
            "Doctor: Have you ever looked into going to a meditation center?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, there is one in the Square. It would be at night for him to go out at night. It would be\n",
            "Doctor: And it doesn't have to be.\n",
            "Patient: We have something to do that exercise. That was something relaxing that was not watching TV and eating chocolate which is what we end up doing. Yeah, well wings.\n",
            "Doctor: It would be nice to have things to do together sort of an adventure to a park and bark.\n",
            "Patient: Use of coffee every time he has one of these things happen for a little while.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is God.\n",
            "Patient: And so I thought he might want to go out and have coffee with me the other day and like he could get sea or something and he wouldn't go out to the coffee shop. I don't know you can't take that away from us with nothing left to do.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you worry about having nothing to do?\n",
            "Patient: No, you just have a lot of fun together. Just hanging out, but it becomes a problem after a week because of his problem.\n",
            "Doctor: You go a little stir crazy.\n",
            "Patient: Yep, you lose all perspective and get depressed even with going to school at still and he's not going to go back to school for a while this semester. He is going to be mostly working on a thesis or she'll be at home a lot and we will really do we really do need something.\n",
            "Doctor: The main structure for the two of you to do and remind for yourself at even though he can't go out and go for a run or go for a hike or go for a ride with you. You can still do those things. It's important for you to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Have you done restorative yoga? I think I could get him to do that over the medication. He doesn't do well with sitting like in a total silence around other people.\n",
            "Doctor: Darkness\n",
            "Patient: What's restorative yoga discipline you line the dark? Maybe we'll try that.\n",
            "Doctor: or even a really gentle practice. He could probably do just a more half a base to rather than Vinyasa Style.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he get those are going to regular yoga classes. He feels like it's a competition that he can't do anything and everyone else around him is doing he has kind of worked up about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Ashley had a yoga teacher used to say this is not a competition. Yoga is not a competitive sport.\n",
            "Patient: Seattle say things like that. Sometimes they'll be like, okay, it's playtime around your handstands.\n",
            "Doctor: And it's important to not that you not go to that.\n",
            "Patient: End up feeling bad about himself every time. And it can't be heated or if you like start getting nauseous. He also has trouble kind of like when I do if I am kind of not feeling good and I play too much attention to my body that I must get a little depressed and\n",
            "Doctor: What about doing some experimentation and finding a class or Studio? That's the right fit you might want to go and try out some first before you have him come to make sure it's not going to be a class that has a sort of competitive nature. So I make sure it's not one. That's not too active.\n",
            "Patient: accepting the idea of going to a meditation center is going to\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe too far out there. kind of stretching him one step from where he is rather than jumping too far out and then it will feel like if it doesn't fit so just going to a gentle flow class might be a good fit with that a little bit of meditation thrown in at the end usually\n",
            "Patient: I've got to do those. I mean, he's been spending so much time looking up the trials worrying about I mean he had an eye twitch and is afraid his electrolyte levels were off. And unfortunately, he said the Doctor Who clearly also is a hypochondriac like oh, yeah. I had an eye twitch to you in a medical school in my wife's an optometrist. So who needs the stress that was funny, but I think I got more stress from\n",
            "Doctor: So you're worried about him?\n",
            "Patient: well, I mean\n",
            "Doctor: You just can't be there for his heart.\n",
            "Patient: Things that he's trying all the supplements. He takes all the stuff he does. He doesn't try to make himself calm.\n",
            "Doctor: He's lucky to have you.\n",
            "Patient: Yap and Layla he tells me that which is always nice to cure.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and you're lucky to have him he's got you up and out of the house and running this morning, which is a great listener mode.\n",
            "Patient: Well, right.\n",
            "Doctor: To take care of each other.\n",
            "Patient: I mean last year none of this happened.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: I want to like go out to do anything and she was depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: sad and kind of afraid to let you go. So you really have found he's found different ways. It sounds like to cope with it and you found different ways to cope with that as a couple because you need to find a way that you're both taken care of and it sounds like you're figuring that out.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it is. Yeah. I hope that things are continuing to improve very slowly.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like they are. Are there other things we should catch up on because I do want to make time to do some relaxation. So I'm conscious of saving time for today. So let's do a good long breathing practice and some relaxation. Let's do copay before we get relaxed to break your eye looking for checks or money.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, that's why I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: That's all right. All right. So just to let yourself get comfortable and close your eyes. Let yourself settle into a rhythm of breathing that feels comfortable and relaxed and feels natural to you and you can continue to allow yourself to breathe and comfortable. How do you spell in the place of your breath as we go through the relaxation to start scan your body from the top of your head down through your torso all the way to your feet allowing yourself to noticed when your body feels like without judging just taking notice of where you feel relaxed. And why are you feel tense? Also take a moment to become aware of what's in your head acknowledge the thoughts that are there and then let them go without any judgment allowing yourself to be present in the moment. Perhaps noticing the sound of things around you just noticing them and then letting them pass on and then when you're ready for your next encounter as you inhale you squeeze your eyes tightly shut noticing how that brings more time your face, whenever you're ready to ask how you're going to let that go letting your eyes remain gently closed and repeating that as you inhale squeezed in your eyes tightly shut and then when you're ready to ask about letting that go Your eyes gently closed and I was seeing what it feels like to be relaxed when the next breath and you're going to squeeze your teeth together clenching your jaw noticing where that brings attention to your job and your face and as you ask a lot of shots drop and your teeth depart least like letting go of that time and Helen clenching your teeth at 7 and letting that go shopping your chin and letting your teeth, part on your next and how you're going to drop your chin forward toward your chest noticing that feels like on your neck and your throat and when you're ready to ask Allah your had to float out to rest down your spine and how about in your head forward actually, let it rise up on the next breath and you're going to drop your head to one side to your ears your shoulder know seeing what that feels like on your back then as you exhale let your head float out to a neutral position and how your head to the opposite shoulder exhaling letting it blowed up to the center noticing how your neck feels different and the next and how you shrug your shoulders towards your ears noticing where that brings attention to your Shores your neck or your upper back. What do you mean drop all the way down as you ask him and how shocking up exhale and released in him and you're going to bend your elbows bringing your hands toward your shoulders noticing what that feels like in your biceps. And then as you exhale, what does arms fall and relaxing all the way in hell been in the elbows? And then you ask not letting those arms go out of your shoulders and your arms and your next and how you're going to make tight best nursing wear that brings X into your forearms wrist and fingers exhale release the tension drain out of your fingertips and how squeezing those tight this XL released but it all go in Helen focused on tighten your abdomen wall squeezing your belly button toward your spine. And as you exhale let your stomach relax a full deep breath pain in your belly be soft and how you're going to squeeze your belly button for tightening your stomach again. And then as you exhale, let your belly be soft taking a full deep breath. when you next and how you're going to squeeze your knees together as tightly as you can nursing the tension in your inner thighs when you're ready to Exhale, let your legs relax your knees make Inhale squeezes needs together XL and releasing let your legs fall apart when the next breath and you're going to straighten your legs looking up off the floor notice for you feel tension in your body. And when you're ready to ask a lot of attention when your feet fall asleep or letting the floor do the work of zorbing the weight of your likes on the next. Anyhow, you're going to lift those beat up again noticing attention Crafts near hips and thighs and as you actually I'll release it and let your lights come down and heroin bust in your feet. But your toes comes off the floor back towards, you know, just where the Springs passion to your lower legs and your feet and when you're ready to inhale exhale and relax your legs and relax your feet, let your toes be in hell and flexes feet toes back towards you notice what it feels like and then releases you ask about reversing that movement you're going to inhale impress those toes down to the floor cleaning your feet down release letting your heels come down in your feet relax and healing Point those toes down for the 4XL and relax on your next in-house. Can your body becoming aware of the place? Does your tension has refused to leave or may have returned to you as you exhale think about relaxing that space letting the tension drain away for being that process? Stubborn places where attention has refused to leave allowed to leave waxing your body as you actually take a moment to notice again the thoughts that may have entered into your mind and let them go without any judgment for what you're going to have to repeat that process as many times as it feels useful knows he might you feel noticing what you noticed your head and then letting it go giving yourself a moment to be free after you relax. And let yourself count to a few more breast memorizing what it feels like to be as relaxed as you are. And when you feel ready let yourself carry that feeling back to you to the room taking it with you good job, and I will see you in two weeks or week and a half after Friday.\n",
            "Patient: at 3:30\n",

            "Doctor: How are you?\n",
            "Patient: It sounds odd, but I'm kind of feeling over therapist. I don't know if that makes sense, but I'm actually not sure.\n",
            "Doctor: meaning like\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm finding myself with a I'm finding myself really emotionally exhausted.\n",
            "Doctor: What considerably?\n",
            "Patient: Well sometimes but sometimes Cell Therapy helps and I don't know like I don't know like if I don't want to like talk about dealing with some things or if I want to meet less frequently for a while or what?\n",
            "Doctor: I get it.\n",
            "Patient: With the you know, of course always are I just want to avoid dealing with myself?\n",
            "Doctor: Sprite\n",
            "Patient: Which is always an option. I don't know like I was thinking about this a little bit like you know, so and then I use the sort of stair like no, I think like I like meeting frequently, but right now I don't know and it's not like meeting frequently for some of that but I don't know I guess because I think what I want is some relief from I just don't want to have to deal with it or think about like difficult stuff like like one of the things I hated about out was feeling like I don't want to do this again. Like I don't know I felt like I've already talked about that a lot and it's really hard and I don't want to like go back to square one of that, but then I saw her again and I think I was more circumstantial.\n",
            "Doctor: This is when you were on the bus with her.\n",
            "Patient: This was when I was at the bus stop.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it was at the movie theater.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: and then like last week, I was at a coffee shop with a friend and right outside the window A car pulled up and she got out and started you no fussing with her stuff and got out and left or I don't know but I was facing directly out to the window and what sort of give that is I mostly was just like I don't really feel stressed about like I don't think I'm going to feel stressed unless she walks in to this where I am like the shop that I'm in but like seeing her doing whatever wasn't feeling stressful, which was good because I just I guess seeing her just brought back so many negative like just really bad and made it like doing and just I don't think I don't to be like I just don't know. I don't want to do it like I do but I don't know if that makes sense because I didn't feel any like anything good about not being upset or scared her her of her or having like longing for her and then the situation with the bus. I felt like I don't know like I rebooted almost but that's what it felt like that like on the moment. I just mostly just that once I got home and the next day a few days. I just got in the game. Oh God, like do I have to do this all over again if that makes sense? and then I'm always I'm frequently reluctant to say this about myself that I have PTSD and extremely I find it extremely difficult to say that I was in an abusive relationship in which I can kind of say that Unlike with the Boston bombings. I'm just all of that and my parents. I don't know the kind of just don't I don't know. I don't. Yeah, I'm just having this like but I don't like I guess it's not like when I went okay, but I think we should talk about this even though I don't want to.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: It's more like I just don't want to.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: But I don't want to stop meeting entirely because I'm confident about it. And yeah, like there's that therapy is kind of hard. I think with the other thing with that one of the things that I find helpful sort of comforting or something like that. Like when I'm feeling is I make myself do routines of like, okay, you have to get up by this time. You have to be out the door. You have to buy your coffee. You think I'm like when you get home you have to do like these things and I'm doing that but it's still like I guess it's not that it's not helpful because it is but it's not being as I guessed helpful as it usually feel like I feel like I'm still missing things and dropping things and not remembering like yesterday at work. I just had I was having one of those work days. It was super disrupted which was like I was so tired when I got in at 9:30 someone came up my co-workers and was like, there's nobody at the reference desk and someone needs help with the microphone. I'm just like, okay, I guess I'll help them and I asked them to like find a reference Librarian from the office and have them come. because after they did that and then like I was up and down checking like something else for the so like I didn't really sit at my desk for my 15 minutes ish, which I just felt like I couldn't carry a thought is that make sense? Like I thought I couldn't sit at my desk long enough to sort of like I guess start like a pot and then finish it and then like, I don't know like I just I'm so tired. I'm like, I don't know part of it. I'm sleeping. Well, but also I just feel so like I really feel ambushed and overwhelmed. And I really don't like I've been partially part of that one of the things that was part of it was I was just like I can't go through this like I just felt like I don't like I kind of was coping with it. But I do I really feel like I was I was kind of like I'm making a series of fly-by-night decisions that aren't exactly decisions more like reaction and like I don't know it's just so I'm feeling so out of control and not able to like take care of me and just like yeah like it's hard. Like does it get better? I was like today like take care of me. I thought I was having a hard time telling anyone else. What was the problem and then also which always stresses me out? Like I ran out of the cat food the one my cat likes cats like and they both are meowing cats. So I was just about that. I'm like, I'm sorry you're yelling, but I can't do anything about this right now. I don't know just like all of that together. Just I guess it does like it does make me feel crazy in a way like like sometimes I'm flatlining and also like well, you know, maybe it's comic like a you're experiencing for a longer time side effects or whatever, but I don't know I feel so frustrated in the end that like reading fiction and watching like TV or movies, which I do a lot. I don't know. I really don't want to or can't watch anything but like is difficult I guess. my roommates obsessed with Breaking Bad, which I don't watch and usually if she's watching it like sometimes I'll sit myself next to her and like or do whatever but right now I'm like I can't be in the room if that's on\n",
            "Doctor: I see it's too disturbing.\n",
            "Patient: yes way too disturbing and like I always find it disturbing but right now I'm just like I can't just teed off or for me to be in the other room. which I actually feel bad about because through feeling bad like she feels bad that I am the I'm exiling myself to the bedroom and I feel bad that she feels bad about that and\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, like\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and she look and just and says I'm being ridiculous about not wanting to watch it or not. If I'm watching TV and she's able to concentrate on anything at all. And I can't on the TV and almost always distracts me except for sports because there's like no. But I'm also super stressed and I don't know who wants to help me with work stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: I also find it super stressful. I also find me super stressful and I don't know like part of me is like yes. I do want to like if you really can't get any also. That probably is like and what would they do? Like what would happen next and also like and then really occupy here like maintaining my own mental health. So if I were to choose I would choose working and keeping my me saying rather than dealing with sexual discrimination and I'm sitting in that group office. I think you almost fall on everyone. It's really like I feel like I feel like I can't relax and concentrate relax or concentrate or I don't know like it's different than being in like a cute Farm behind like there's a penis or whatever. Because like people are just students there just kind of like wandering in and out all the time and I can't say no like because we're an open service area. We're supposed to help anyone that come anybody that comes up but I like the other like other open service areas like the library opens their own reference desk for like an hour or two and they go and sit in their offices and it's so cute. It's like whatever the 6th off for like in the back and the different people like on duty and whatever someone and say someone comes up person for like that anyone has to deal with it and I tried to and have not been successful and also the process in doing that is just so exhausting like and I guess you say what you do? What do you want me to do about that? I have to work your two and a I don't care and be I think it's a crappy setup and it should be reconsidered reconsidered. It's like somebody being an open kitchen at work. Everyone can stare at you cooking and you can make mistakes and someone is staring at you.\n",
            "Doctor: well, there's a lot to understand but one of the things I I think I heard you say about therapy is that it makes you feel a lot of ways and you're describing it very sort of Expose and washing like I've been kind of stay or wander into whatever party like, you know, and I know what you were talking about in whatever way that gives you crowding or intrusive or attitude out of your control what you did and I know there may be all the stuff. I think you should work on but that doesn't mean you are for it or\n",
            "Patient: Actually, it's more like the stuff that I think I should work on.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: But I don't feel any more.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Got you.\n",
            "Patient: like I don't think that I do not feel like you have the should be it's totally\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I got you.\n",
            "Patient: Sure, I guess as a feeling sometimes I some of this happened yesterday. To that. It feels like I'm kind of jumping into the sort of feelings or associations to what you're talking about kind of like both feet. Like yesterday I about had, you know something that you know was disturbing or that you weren't really upset about having had gone last week or was really shaken up by it. But I guess I had the impression that you know, well, it's already going to be helpful to like mother and to your family. Maybe you probably already did but to kind of be talking about that can also be pretty overwhelming.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I guess.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, it feels like something you sort of lose control over a bit. Like I've got to see what I'm going to say about it. Yeah, which is what I want. But then sometimes also I'm like I would just like I don't know but it's like sometimes I feel like okay. I thought I was dealing with this thing and then it's like oh, but actually it's like this thing, you know, which is good to I'm kind of like I do want to know that I just maybe don't want to know about right now.\n",
            "Doctor: here\n",
            "Patient: Or you don't want to know what to I guess sometimes I don't know what to do with it. It's just it's that like, okay, so I think about all these things, but I'm too tired to it's too much to think about like to continue pressing after.\n",
            "Doctor: You are your own like this and then it becomes this.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Or does it seem to be this? I think.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: and that adds to the\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I think also.\n",
            "Doctor: just a sort of control with what you're actually dealing with or a really a thing I want to say is look I know that it one level. This is clearly what you expect in some cases what you what you want or sort of? What you want?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not I'm not saying that I'm unaware of that. I'm talking more. I'm referring more to like what can feel much better in the moment or what can make it to school that kind of thing if that makes sense.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, it does and that sort of like I mean conflicts or whatever in the moment is freaking really hard like I do anything talking about. My mom is super hard in the moment because part of because like I will I know what it is, like it's called. It's like my brothers psychiatrist saying like the reason you're bipolar is because you're mixed race. and then sort of a few of like that was something that both my brother and I have heard like as well, you know, like I know field marriages but what about the children we get so mixed up and Confused like we\n",
            "Doctor: That would be doing him.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, so it's like I mean, we both say that to like me or him or my parents which we both have. It's like it's incredibly it's incredibly weird. And so like my first reaction is generally like fuck you. I'm fine. Like actually I'm also What are you talkin about? And so then it becomes difficult to be like well actually mistakes are made but not because my parents are different races, but for other reasons and so sometimes it feels really hard to kind of like be like, nope. We're not we're like this is not actually a discussion about whether or not my parents made a mistake and having children.\n",
            "Doctor: bright\n",
            "Patient: But like I guess like it's hard to that's my knee-jerk reaction is to sort of defend the concept of having mixed race kids.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not like I have emotional problems not because of like racial and that's also one of those things where I feel like people like people like to use the existence of interracial families and mixed race people has like a metaphor. I was like look racism isn't over because of law or like I am the embodiment of the end of racism and racial unity and that's a lot for a person and I also don't mix combination. And so I don't know I feel like I've had a lot of conversations and which I thought because I felt like oh we're talking about me, but we're not actually we were talking about like like they're trashing a mixed-race person the symbolic person and so it's like I have this like, you know, instead of like things that getting out of that can be hard but I'm unwittingly trampling all this stuff. Yeah, I mean even if that is true, I just don't I don't know. I don't think about that a lot probably because Messi incredibly high standard of not a good job, okay? Or like over being because over being can like yeah, okay high standards, but I mean it's more than what I'm used to and I'm like used to getting I think like it doesn't always register.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah, I would imagine that if it's registered as much as such before now you would have said so.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah coming from them. You have said things that I disagreed with.\n",
            "Doctor: I did. Yeah, absolutely. This isn't coming across to me as something that you said. It's like knowing you had trouble saying so as something that was unclear was kind of in the way. That was in making you feel bad in the way that it would.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, the other thing is that I've been thinking about is I when we talked at one point about doing like I was surprised as to how strong a reaction I had the idea of not being able to see you like\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, okay.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was two one was lie down into lying down and not being able to see you sort of come by and I just like which it's not the money has been an issue for me before and like I've had male gynecologist and was like don't care, you know, like the gender of like whoever is treating me doesn't has never been an issue for me and suddenly I'll say this actually feels like a huge thing. I got a massage recently and a friend of mine was like, oh my male partner does massage and he might or barter and I thought I'm not sure if I can let a guy massage me right now. Like I have in the past like a lot not a lot but like it's not been something that I've cared about and I just had this like very strong sort of like nope, like nope. Nope. Nope. Nope, and then had this week. Why is this why is it so troubling to be right now? Like I guess and it's still kind of percolating or something. things I guess like you're Is like the environment in some way?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's the fear of not being able to tell but it might happen.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: And then not being able to do anything about it. But if after the first beer it is not being able to see I'm not it's not something that's been like I don't know. I don't like what I don't like living like you're hanging but I mean that's like but just to me it's sort of like but I I know who this person is and yet I feel I still feel scared about it and it feels like intense intensity. Like I guess I feel like I'm like, I'm even an irrational fear of like that's not actually going to happen. You are not going to leave out like an action move but like it's just like a rational crazy feeling like in my head. Feel like I guess it's really like not getting a warning not being able to read somebody else's body language or is it there is something I guess not like not getting a warning. And all of a sudden just being with a monster. I think it's kind of it's a a lot of how I feel. I just be sort of what happened here. And I also started realize this but I was thinking recently how I'm doing like public speaking or meeting. I spend a lot of time looking at people's body language and like trying to I guess trying to read where like reading is going where people are going like I can really I can get really caught up in like am I sitting pissed off am I sitting whatever?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, we can stop for now.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you have any idea what you want to do or talk about some more next week and then try to make a decision?\n",
            "Patient: I think I want to talk about it more next week.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Except I may be really exhausted on Monday. I'm going to be out of town all weekend.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: Stick with Tuesday and talk about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I think I probably have the midday appointments during the rest of the week. Do you want to look at those now, or do you want to just go just meet Tuesday and go from there?\n",
            "Patient: I want to talk to you on Tuesday and go from there.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, let's do that.\n",
            "Patient: XVI\n",
            "Doctor: See you next Monday so that\n",
            "Patient: Monday is the 15th.\n",
            "Doctor: All right, then. I'll see you on Tuesday.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: Good morning. I had a good day yesterday. It was feeling like spring maybe one day. It's feeling like spring but you know good enough. So I took the kids out to the playground. And they started packing her me thinks that moving could be really good. I don't know. back to waiting and seeing I don't know enough what the options are. It occurred to me this morning that even if I had stayed at Brown and James had moved us here. We would still be in this position at this point where I really didn't want to do a postdoc. So I guess it's a little bit reassuring. It would still be tough right now. We are supposed to go to this party with most of James's friends grad school were in the Denver area this weekend. Our car is still not running. So I don't know. I think there's a commuter rail we can take but it's like an hour's Drive Away by the commuter rail.\n",
            "Doctor: It's out in.\n",
            "Patient: Outwest. It's way out west onto I don't know. I don't know but I did find out that Monica only wants me to come in for a couple 3 hours on Friday if that so that would be nice. I have a tough time with the people from James is grad school program. It's just always sort of stressful. I like them. They're fine. We're just really different from me. Then I think well, they're also really different from James. I don't know. I think that was one of the things that was tough for James in Ohio get trouble finding people to talk to which is why it was so great. When his friend from undergrad Tony and his wife Carrie were there because Cody is a poet he could talk to him. How do you sort of crazy in some ways I can never tell whether he believes ideas. He's putting out there or whether it's more that he thinks the world would be more fun if it were true. And so he's just sort of hoping that they're true. I don't know. I don't much easier time finding friends than James does and I don't know whether that's because I am I don't know better at finding people or less picky about the people that I want to be friends with or whether it's because I'm just positioned right in a way that James is not I don't know if the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in chemistry are all that different from the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in theology. It's not a difference. What I don't know if we did move. This will be the first time that I moved to a new city where I didn't know anybody or didn't know more than a couple of people and wasn't already in some sort of graduate program or workplace or something to Anchor me. It doesn't make me anxious, but I feel like maybe it ought to. I think that that could go really badly, but I can't get worried about that. I don't know. Even with knowing so many people it hasn't really kept me from being really lonely here. It's a weird thing one day. I'll be talking to James about it or thinking about it and be like yeah. Yeah, let's go somewhere else. Let's find a new place and see what the options are. There's almost no where else in the country where my skills would be less valuable than they are here in terms of there being a critical mass of people with a Humanities degree here.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: There are a lot of people who are brown educated in some of your discipline here just a lot of them and it's really fun. But it also means that finding a job is that much harder and that's not going to be the case in other places. I feel like there's almost no situation. That would not be better for James than what we were in now. It makes a huge difference in my life when he's doing. Well when I'm not the only person that he has to talk to about interesting. Things like this is for us. Some days, I think that and then other days is just like Terror yesterday was sort of the ladder and today is sort of the former and I don't know. obviously you coming to that but it's not clear to me how\n",
            "Doctor: One thing that accursed me is your feeling relatively well good. I guess like yesterday the other day and stay and it's like you don't need me in the same way if you're feeling good.\n",
            "Patient: yeah. It's hard to make decisions across emotional states. I always wonder whether everyone is like this like the whole landscape changes on your having a bad day or when you're having a good day. I imagine if I think about it most things are spectrum and blah blah blah. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's a little more for you. Not then for everybody but more than for most people.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks. Yeah, it's certainly not the case for James and it certainly like every once in a while. We'll have an explicit conversation about it. We're all say James. This is how I work when I'm having a good day. It looks really different than when I'm having a bad day. I can't see anything outside of my emotions. I think it makes things very confusing for him. It makes things very confusing for me also at times. Oh, well, I feel like if I can tell something and get other people to help remind me of that. Maybe it won't matter so much that I can't remember it myself.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess part of it is that it's not just that it's different I think but that less now but still to some extent without realizing it you lose touch with what it's really like the other way.\n",
            "Patient: yeah I feel like the extent to which I have sort of changed that has been more like remembering that I lose touch and actually not losing touch and that's even not that great so it's like in the last couple to three weeks even I'll be like in this awful place just totally miserable and desperate and kind of crazy making and then I go to do something usually with something for church and acts like I'm okay and after about a half-hour somebody will ask how are you doing and I'll be like Oh I'm great and it's not like I'm lying I believe it but it's just like at that moment I'm only thinking about the part of my life that is right here right now which means that I'm having an interesting conversation or I'm doing okay Sometimes I feel like it helps me survive again helps me get through those really bad times. It's weird. I feel like it's impossible for me to be honest in some ways. If I say actually I'm not doing so well that is true with regards to the macro state, but it doesn't actually reflect what's going on in that moment. If I say I'm doing great and that reflects what's going on in the moment, but it's a very small moment compared to what's really happening. I wonder when people stop believing what I say. It was as pretty Facebook conversation last night about deaf children and Cochlear implants a bad choice and all of that. I don't know if it was talking like people clearly didn't know very many deaf people or weren't in touch with that Community because it was very why would you ever Not give your child a chance to hear. That is an incredibly cruel and a terrible Choice. Yes language is culture and that would be bad if that were lost. But no really it's more important to be hearing. I don't know what I think about that but it's not really important. Joanne is a interpreter and she's really involved with the deaf community and used to teach primary school kids who are deaf. So she's pretty anti cochlear implant and pretty firmly an advocate for the deaf community. I was sort of seeing both sides of it and I guess I was just thinking about how you don't see what is outside your experience. People say why do parents choose not to give their children a chance of having a whole other sense? Well, they don't have it and they like their life and they don't know in some instances. They can't know what they're missing and also people who have that extra sense can't know what they're missing by having it.\n",
            "Doctor: I follow like the people in the conversation yesterday on Facebook or sort of making these comments and judgments very much within their own worldview without necessarily realizing how much they are in their own worldview. There is kind of another side.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and since it's about perception, it's been nice link to the conversation to be having. I was reading a poem called Monet refuses the operation. It was about the painter describing it took me 55 years to learn how to see like this and now you want to fix my eyes. What is a nice poem? I guess I was just thinking how it was relatively recent that it occurred to me that other people might not work like this like these so controlled by their emotional states like half the landscape be so dependent on emotions. Maybe everyone else is like that just in different ways and I don't know. I just feel like people who say their judgments are wholly dependent on their emotional state are mostly full of bullshit. My favorite Old Testament scholar gave a lecture on Saturday in the line. I really liked was up until about the mid-twentieth century scholarship was all about objectivity. And that was the gold standard of objectivity. and then we eventually just realized an objective it e was just white male experience. That was nice. You would think that I was going somewhere but I know this is how Amanda works so that also makes it hard. She is much more polarity than I do in some ways. So I feel like sometimes I talk to her from time to time and it will be like she just has had this completely different idea of what her life looks like in one conversation then a week later. That I get but I feel like sometimes were just really far separated. So when we try to talk, I just don't know what she's saying at all. Sometimes we're really there together and sometimes we just can't even talk. Part of me wants to be like, is there a diagnosis for that and part of me is like I don't think it really matters that much. I don't know which of those I actually want to clean this my opinion. I feel like I know which of those you would fall on butt.\n",
            "Doctor: You mean?\n",
            "Patient: Your approach tends to be like I don't think that matters all that much. It's funny talking with people in the hospital people get very attached their diagnosis. I think I only noticed that because I don't have one in the same way. I don't think I'm really expecting you to weigh in on this much. I feel like sometimes when I talk about stuff. I really want you to say something about it or speak from experience, but I don't really feel like that's the case right now.\n",
            "Doctor: Sometimes it is true because I do think there are times that it can be helpful to have one formal given diagnosis or informally something about depending on what the Dynamics are having the sense of part of what you're finding with me is that there are with the people hide behind that or use it to move away from what their experience actually is another words what I mean is depression is not very descriptive compared to something like paranoid schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder those things seem more descriptive than things like depression or generalized anxiety.\n",
            "Patient: I think that depression is about as useful a description as fever in some ways.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, where is I do think that something like paranoid schizophrenia or disorder are a little more useful. I think it doesn't say a lot about who the person is.\n",
            "Patient: The one thing that I've been I've seen in talking to people who have a bipolar diagnosis, it is clear that that is a really useful thing for them to know about themselves.\n",
            "Doctor: Absolutely particularly bipolar one, it looks pretty biological in the sense that for some people bipolar is affected a lot by what is going on in their environment for other people. It just isn't and for those people it's really good to know.\n",
            "Patient: I was just thinking about Amanda. I feel like from where I said, it looks to me a lot like she is bipolar 2 and she doesn't want to be involved in mental Healthcare. Basically. She doesn't want to take meds and okay. I don't know. I wonder how her life would be different if she were not making that choice.\n",
            "Doctor: Like if she were getting treated and thinking more of herself in those terms stuff like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I don't know if it would be better. It would be different. I think it might be better.\n",
            "Doctor: might not\n",
            "Patient: She's had some really bad therapist. So I did so\n",
            "Doctor: Another thing it seems to be where we're at with some of this in a way. I'm quite sure what to make of or what to do with how to think about when you're feeling more this way the way you are today. Well not in my mind because it's feeling better per se but I guess for reasons that at least to me so far are not entirely clear maybe because you're feeling kind of strong I think.\n",
            "Patient: Like I don't swing by lently in this direction so much as I just saunter over there.\n",
            "Doctor: When you're this way at least me it doesn't seem like your kind of has possessed by the things that you feel or perhaps. You don't know what those things are. You're talking about how it might be really nice to me, but I'm not really sure why it's not that I don't believe you but I don't know what you really have in mind about the changes. I guess you mentioned that it might be easier to get a job, but I don't expect that's all what you meant. You said it would be better for James. Although again. I'm not sure why and I can certainly see how if it would be better for him. It would also be better for you seem somehow. It's a little less clear to me so far.\n",
            "Patient: In some ways. I feel like what I'm doing. Well, it's very common for me to want to be doing something else to be like I want to explore I want to go someplace else and see what else is out there. I also think it would be nice to be closer to family like it would be nice to be back in San Antonio. It's like I can remember other times when I was happy and the physical location of those times. So I guess that's less exploring and more like I want to go back there. I can't remember what it was like to live in San Antonio when I'm depressed because I remember that it's being really happy so it doesn't I feel like it's less important for me to tell you about it when I'm doing better. Like when I sat A desperate I described it constantly inside my head if I'm really down. I'll often try to think how I would tell somebody about it. What would I say? I feel less urgent. Which is a little depressing in itself.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you thinking that it seems a little less self-reflective or more bland or something?\n",
            "Patient: I just think it's a little depressing and that what I feel is so urgent for me to put out in the world is all the worst stuff that happens that is inside me. The good things seem less important to spread around and I don't know. I don't really think I'm comfortable with that idea. I guess I also feel like everyone would understand what it feels like to be doing pretty well and enjoying my job.\n",
            "Doctor: To me, it seems like you don't need as much help hearing those things or maybe any by contrast. I guess I can also see you in a way how you were feeling like being well if I'm thinking about how to tell people about this is because I want to spread it out into the world or but these bad things out there in the world. Do you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: More something like you're looking for some help with how bad you feel.\n",
            "Patient: I was talking to Camilla about how I was feeling pretty bad Sunday, and I said something I said. I think I said that I don't understand how Denver hasn't been swallowed up in earthquakes with how sad I feel she was like that really sucks. That was really pretty. Thanks. The thing is I feel so bad about putting things on people. I want to find a way to make it bearable for them.\n",
            "Doctor: We should stop for now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, how are you today?\n",
            "Patient: I figured you were running late.\n",
            "Doctor: I just had to run for something quick. Sorry about that.\n",
            "Patient: It's chilly out. I didn't get coffee. So if I seem slow and unable to think I have closing today.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh good.\n",
            "Patient: Which I've gone to squeeze. I just got another day with all kinds of stuff. It kind of stresses me out to have to have things all lined up throughout the day. The club got to meet Jess's mom to put the carseat in the car so she can go pick up Lucille. She wants to take Ian. So it's not a shocking for Lucille. So they need both car seats. Then I've got to go back and get eaten for Cub Scouts. It's the big pack meeting. I've never been to a pack meeting. So I don't know what we're going to do there and sleeping over.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you like a den. Or something or you just going?\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm just a dull in the Cub Scouts. You've got to go with your kid. You don't just drop them off which I imagine. Maybe the older kids just get dropped off. I don't know. It's going good. I tell you how I lost my bedroom.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: He's going to sleep in my bed tonight. He's going to learn to skate tomorrow. It's going through March that seems like an awful long time to teach kids to ski, I would think that at some point they give them a stick and a puck and I don't know. So I got to do that. Tomorrow is Cub Scouts are visiting a fire station at 10 meet. I really got the winner's share of the farm all male players on my team are going out Saturday night and Sunday. I have a football game.\n",
            "Doctor: What are you going to do with all your free time?\n",
            "Patient: Well, hopefully and we'll go to bed early Sunday morning. I'll probably end up sleeping late. I'll probably be a little hung over. The whole thing just makes me anxious. I don't know if it's just the closing that makes me anxious or if it's having all of these things to do at a week. Of a week of a kind of coming home and just doing titles and working from home. I've been going to the office but going home in the afternoon. There's no real pressure or stress on me to get things done or should I have got I mean I have got plenty of time. I've already got. I had to order an uploaded updated playoff. So I've been waiting on that. I want to tell dr. Micah on Tuesday apps for she was cutting back my well room. And then in the very end, she asked me are you depressed and I go a little bit she was like, oh, we don't want to go down on the Wellborn if you're depressed, so I have to lie to her next time. No, I'm not depressed. I'm feeling great.\n",
            "Doctor: You want to go down and I guess your concern is making you more anxious. Could you tell her that that that's more of an issue than your depression?\n",
            "Patient: I just wake up. I see you're after Thanksgiving.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. It seems to me sort of characteristic that the actual story is a perfect perfectly reasonable story, but you're thinking you'd better tell her a different story because somehow that seems more like it could get you what you want. Even though the actual story is like I said, not only pretty reasonable but would serve you just as well.\n",
            "Patient: I'll try it then. I'm glad you're picking up on these things.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: I couldn't remember. She said to go up on the Prozac and I can't remember if she told me not to go up on the Prozac but I'm going up on it. Anyways now taking 25mg of the laundry. a lot of my green in the morning\n",
            "Doctor: What's that?\n",
            "Patient: the West series cast\n",
            "Doctor: Less than or more.\n",
            "Patient: more so I'm taking a hundred at night and 25 in the morning. I think she's trying to get me on that and the Prozac and that's it. Maybe the copper play. I don't know as needed which is all the time. I don't seem anxious when I go to bed because I fall asleep on the couch and I wake up all discombobulated.\n",
            "Doctor: Good. I mean not the discombobulated part, but\n",
            "Patient: But not being anxious. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: and it sounds like it has something to do with having all this stuff to do I guess my impression is that most of it isn't stuff that and itself is hard or worrisome in terms of what it involves more like things have kind of got to go right? You're not going to have a lot of time to be worried or be down or be distracted. So maybe you're kind of worried of what will happen if you're feeling one of those ways.\n",
            "Patient: Or just if there is some pick up somewhere. I'm always wary of hiccups, you know, like they just forgot to get a baby at banks. Are they going to be able to get a big truck? They've got to bring like 6,000 closing? So is she going to have time to do that? Maybe she will maybe she won't I don't know. I'm not going to risk. The of a personal check for $6,000. I guess you have to the only way to be safe on a deposit in 10 days is 10 days.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, really?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess maybe at that point. You can't dispute it against another bank.\n",
            "Doctor: You mean if it hasn't been returned in 10 days, it's good.\n",
            "Patient: Right. So Bank of America. If you depart deposit large amounts of money will hold it for 10 days, which I tell people they should get it get wire first. I tell them they shouldn't do Bank of America, but they should do they should get the money wired because the bank takes too long. I didn't have anyone to go to the game. So I sent out an email. I'm now going to get now getting all of these emails. Is it time are we done?\n",
            "Doctor: Not yet.\n",
            "Patient: There was a lot of traffic to\n",
            "Doctor: Does this feel like just something else you just had to do this morning?\n",
            "Patient: No, not really. It's like I did some work this morning taking a shower. I don't know why I just always feel is a chore, but I had to take one today after two weeks. I'm going to take a shower. I need a haircut. I should have gotten one today. I always by Supercuts I think. You get a $100 haircut.\n",
            "Doctor: It's $50, I think.\n",
            "Patient: is Ghana\n",
            "Doctor: Just after my pilates class.\n",
            "Patient: it's always a roll of the dice. When you go to Supercuts. You never know. If you're going to get shockingly. My hair is not easy to 10. They're afraid of me being bald and then on the top if it's too short, it sticks straight up. I'm like just cut it short it will grow back. It saves me money because it's the less. I have to get my haircut cut it short. I'll let it grow long. A girl like 4 times a year. The break defends on the year. I was hoping we were somehow going to avoid and playing hockey. It's just very expensive. You've got to buy him equipment every year they can get used equipment but there weren't any used helmets had to buy a new helmet just bought them. So I don't care as much at some point it gets expensive. It should be entertaining though him learning to skate falling over all over the place those little kids he hasn't signed up. So I'm anxious about that. I forgot to sign him up and we're bringing the check.\n",
            "Doctor: Where is it?\n",
            "Patient: You know the one you know where the YMCA YMCA is there is a rank two blocks from the house. He's already been to the Firehouse but\n",
            "Doctor: Can't take too many trips to the Firehouse.\n",
            "Patient: I guess not this Cub Scout stuff is kind of frequent. There's a lots of things to do. There's another meeting. There's a dead meaning. I'm trying to get all straight between dens last pass.\n",
            "Doctor: He is a busy fellow.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: soccer and hockey and Cub Scouts\n",
            "Patient: stalkers gone\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: but yeah, he's got a lot of energy, you know, if he just sit around the house. He just bounces he doesn't do it when he comes over to my place. He just kind of sits things out and watches cheap we go out to dinner and his mellow but when he's home with Jesse pushes her out a lot more than he pushes me and talk to you doesn't really push me at all.\n",
            "Doctor: In what ways does he pressure?\n",
            "Patient: Just not listening.\n",
            "Doctor: bouncing around not listening\n",
            "Patient: Don't bring stuff in here and he brings the food in here. Don't bring food in here and he brings the food in here.\n",
            "Doctor: up on the couch.\n",
            "Patient: Right, so I don't know why he acts really different with me just probably because he's around her enough that he knows her buns. He hasn't figured out mine yet or maybe Sears me I took a.m.\n",
            "Doctor: You know there could be any number of reasons. I don't think that it's that he's not around you enough not to know your buns. He would learn those pretty fast.\n",
            "Patient: When he does come over and he does spend a lot of time downstairs running around so he gets a lot of his energy out there so loud.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. I'm very much speculating here, but it sounds like Jesse's sort of on him a fair amount and worried about him a lot and he could be kind of pushing back.\n",
            "Patient: That's probably it. It sounds more like Jess.\n",
            "Doctor: That's why I'm careful to say that I don't really know but he just doesn't do the same thing with you. There could be some of that on his side to where he feels a little meteor for her in a way, you know, Mom comforting stuff like that. He kind of gives her a hard time because of that which sometimes kids do\n",
            "Patient: Or is it just trying to get attention?\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe it's to compete more was Lucille if it's around her sure.\n",
            "Patient: easiest to me ignoring him\n",
            "Doctor: No, it's probably not that I mean, I don't know how much you ignore him, but it's not something kids get used to.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know him that much. Yes, so many damned questions.\n",
            "Doctor: He sounds like a very energetic vigorous curious active kid.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's great. I mean it's especially tough for the people who have to look after him all the time. I mean, those are very nice qualities. I'm not saying it's not the easiest one for you, but it's pretty nice.\n",
            "Patient: It'll be interesting. He doesn't seem I don't know he's kind of skinny. So it's like I don't know how he would get do getting banged around in hockey when they're little they don't go flying into each other. They just kind of bingen to each other and fall down. They don't know what they're doing unless they have another brother and then they dominate I noticed that with soccer all the kids with all her brothers were much better. I had a kid who scored 7 goals who had all who has two older brothers.\n",
            "Doctor: They play with them more and they have to play up to their brothers.\n",
            "Patient: Like Lucille when she starts soccer, she'll be much better than one even started because she already been kicking around a ball Lucille's another year-and-a-half. It will be two and a half years before she can play instead of being cranky sitting in our little stroller at some point. She'll become more wanting to play and run around. She does that sum to but sometimes she just wants to sit in the stroller and being cranky. She doesn't want anyting else starts early. You'll see you see you're choosing your words carefully.\n",
            "Doctor: how to respond to that one\n",
            "Patient: Are you coffee? I'll go home to make coffee. It's such a pain though. Go home the three or four minutes. It takes it takes a while. You got to go you got to wash the pot out empty the thing put in the filter and put the coffee in. I don't know why he's a little things in life should just get in my way the hiccups. I wonder if Lucille is going to go with her grandmother when she picks her up today.\n",
            "Doctor: You mean she might get cranky?\n",
            "Patient: I'm hoping I'll be upset if she doesn't. She doesn't go Mama Mama Mama Mama stand up in the car seat and go no.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that what she does?\n",
            "Patient: That's what you did to me.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: I do not want to go with me when we got home. She literally stood in the driveway was going Mama Mama Mama Mama. Don't you want to play she went mama mama mama, so I just sat down and waited it out. Luckily just was only 10 minutes.\n",
            "Doctor: It's hard being the daddy.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, she doesn't see me often enough.\n",
            "Doctor: How often do you see her?\n",
            "Patient: I haven't seen her since Saturday.\n",
            "Doctor: once or twice a week\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I always for long periods of time. Sometimes she won't interact with me if she's cranky. There should be a coffee shop in this little square. You can never have too too many coffee shops at some point. I'm supposed to feed him.\n",
            "Doctor: You're going to need to feed him I think.\n",
            "Patient: I got to figure out what to do. It's such a pain in the ass.\n",
            "Doctor: We should stop for now. I'll see you on Tuesday next week, but I'm out on Friday.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, that's right next week. I hope you weren't worried. That I do it enough.\n",
            "Doctor: No, you did that often.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: I thought I just saw the first few flakes.\n",
            "Patient: So it's snowing.\n",
            "Doctor: so it is\n",
            "Patient: It's snowing. Yeah, it's mostly been a bit cold and windy.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: So yeah. I still have been feeling not really not feeling great. I don't know. She's like getting its kind of I was at a Sci-Fi convention a big Buckle sci-fi convention this weekend. Did they explain my anxiety anxiety about how I had to stay with friends and\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you had you had been I think hemming and hawing about whether you're going to or not.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I ended up going and so the conventions at the hotel Westin Convention Center of like a big Weston and something like 3,000 people last time I went it was more like 2,000 dish in the plaza. It was really intensely noisy and aggravating in that like there were lots of people in various costumes, which is usually very fun. Like I like that but I was getting frustrated at people with big costumes or big costume Parts like walking in into the aisle or whacking into you said a lot of people were excited to see each other and shrieking all weekend. And then there was the drunk talking too loud in the elevators and just it was like over-stimulating isn't exactly describing it. It's like wow. Is there a lot of really kind of mildly annoying things usually really ramped up and in one space?\n",
            "Doctor: Way too much.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, like way and I wasn't really usually I'll start out at convention and be like all guys you're all over the top. But that's okay teenage girls and salad costumes. That's great.\n",
            "Doctor: In what?\n",
            "Patient: Dalek costumes from Doctor Who Daleks are these evil robots?\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: It used to be that they could only move forward and backward on a flat tread stairs defeated them. And then in the new reboot, someone was like haha. We'll go up the stairs and then they levitated one of the things that these cute little teenage girls. They were wearing like cute little prom dance dresses that look like the Dalek robots and I was like, oh that's cute, you know people do a lot of reinterpretations, which is usually fun, but I sort of never had that, LOL everyone's really jammed in and kind of crazy and annoying, but I still love you moment. I just sort of was oh my God, I hate everyone. I mean also I had a complete break out before packing because I couldn't find a bottle of painkillers had a bottle of Vicodin and I couldn't find it anywhere. So I got super stressed about it like tearing apart my apartment.\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry, what's hurting?\n",
            "Patient: my hip\n",
            "Doctor: That did used to hurt. I know I haven't heard for a while. I don't think we talked about it for a while.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, it's not constant. It's just that it's kind of like well, you know, it's comforting to have the concept of it more than anything and also like walking around a lot blah blah blah. I don't know if I really could say for a while Then I was like, oh shit. I have to leave right now. So that was just a little bit much but it was weird. I didn't exactly I wouldn't say I had a good time. I want to say I had a bad time. It was mostly just a lot is how I felt about it. And this word is there's a significant downside of like I'm acquainted or passingly familiar or friends with a ton of people there and there's like I'm sitting there talking to someone is always a string of people that are like hey, how are you blah blah blah, and it was just like hello, but I'd really like you to go away right now or just like it was hard to just sort of hang out and talk to a few people quietly. Other than like my hotel room even in like I had dinner with some friends in a restaurant Pub attached and of course a whole bunch of people ended up walking by our booth to go to their table and I don't know I guess I kind of missed everything is always been kind of it's big and kind of overwhelming and kind of noisy, but I really miss not having any sort of not really having an issue over everyone Hi or hanging out in a group of more than four people. So that was frustrating the thing I had forgotten or made myself forget is a reason yes panel are really disorganized and half-assed and it drives me crazy people the panelists always talk here to their friends in the front or they'll be like, I'm not prepared. I don't know why I'm here. I just like so even though I knew that I talked out of two panels within 10 minutes. I just was too frustrating. So there was that. I don't know I didn't buy books because the dealers room was too big. I just\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry, it's a what?\n",
            "Patient: the dealers room was really big. It's like a I don't know what else to call it, you know like a big Convention Center space.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you mean it was really big to go in and look around for Stuff?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, you know usually there's like there's some books out there and t-shirts and sort of sci-fi. Jokes through a lot of them a lot kind of like it was I just felt like I can't figure out what I want to this really loud anti Sunday Kind of steak smelling crowd. Like I don't know. I was just kind of having the everything that ever irritates me about the sci-fi fantasy fan and knocked me all weekend. inter interspersed interspersed with hanging out with people I like and talking to them and then being really annoyed at people.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was.\n",
            "Doctor: And have you had that you had you said you hadn't had the experience before of not also having the great to see you guys feeling have you been irritated to this extent?\n",
            "Patient: Not really, although the last time I seriously attended a reason yet, which is a convention. I was really frustrated by like I'm signed up to do a lot of paneling about race and science fiction and kind of wanted to murder half the audience and had someone basically heckled me over a t-shirt that I have that said black nerds Unite.\n",
            "Doctor: That's terrible.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, and\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: yasso\n",
            "Doctor: Those are bad but different.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, because I was just like I did this panel. I'm like, oh, I hate everyone basically and then I laughed and hung out with friends and then and it was so more like parts were definitely fun. And I did like they're usually a dozen parties happening or so and I didn't go to any of them this year. I was just so a I can't drink anything but I just was sort of like I think without a little a drink or something to make this go smooth. I'm like, I need some form of social lubrication here and being around of lot of a lot of really drunk people while sober is boring.\n",
            "Doctor: I can imagine that exhaust for exacerbating a bunch of things already bothered you.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, I mean being with them in the elevators was bad enough, I guess part of what I\n",
            "Doctor: What I'm wondering about is in the medication, I mean I'm like these aren't side effects. They're part of what's affecting you it sounds like the sort of thing is supposed to be helping with and then the other stuff you would help more with or whatever. Didn't get an away. I mean, I know you're having a hard time. It's not like I'm going to it's not like I'm I'm not intending to just blame everything on the medicine, but in that your reaction to this was so different.\n",
            "Patient: I mean part of it was all so yeah, I mean I mentioned before that like guys yelling always makes me nervous so I can mention Hall guys yelling is perhaps not ideal. So it was sort of this mix of feelings. Like is this the medication I might just irritated and like for me the biggest frustration and I was talking to dr. Bond about it and she was like, well, I went up to I guess the clinical I guess you meant she wanted me to wanted me to take of this Alexa was a week ago. So she's like, well, you know, maybe it's more time which I agree with the erratically. I'm just really not enjoying it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And I think the other thing is I'm always worried about expressing anger watt. So even though I'm pretty sure that I didn't come off as particularly ruffled or whatever. I just sort of I just been worried about it and feeling like is this going to be is it going to get more annoying less annoying? Should I just stop going to conventions this big because it's a lot bigger than I usually go to do in this whole like I don't know I guess part of it was that I don't feel like I know if I was feeling more irritated just from the jump because I've been feeling more depressed or if I'm feeling more irritated because of medication or if I was feeling more irritated because I'm obsessed with her concerned about feeling more irritated.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean from where I sit on my hunch, it might be the medication because it seems to me there other times you've been. Really pretty low. We need to talk more about it. I wish I had thought this through more carefully and the medication obviously might have might have but also just I sort of don't buy that you get irritated by being worried about being irritated compared to how you usually are for something like this, you know, even if it was so mark, it doesn't sound like unless I'm misunderstanding the kind of difference by I'm just focus on being irritated, which I don't want to be and yet worried about being and it's making me more irritated but feels like a small difference. But it seems like a big difference. You've been to many conventions and as I understand and this reaction, I've not heard you talk. I mean, I've heard you describe annoying things or people inventions are other things that have happened, but this is like really not enjoying the genre.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah part of this thing where I'm sort of like waffle waffle on is sci-fi conventions, very a lot and are easy as definitely I don't know how to say it. It's kind of Rowdy a little bit Rowdy. It's a little bit drunk It's kind of focused on sex a little bit which comes under the long boring 25 your argument with another sci-fi convention in the area. So\n",
            "Doctor: So there is more of that stuff than they're usually then they're generally is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, the hotel that it's in while there's a lot of a lot of space which is good. The main lobby area is like it was designed for business conventions. Not a ton of people being really social and running around screaming. So, you know, like there's that set up which is kind of like it's really hard to describe. It definitely cemented in my mind that I don't think I like at least right now. I'm not liking that genre of convention like which is I love the costuming that people do but about half the other things I was just like no, I just like having programming running like all through the night. So they're doing gaming and movies.\n",
            "Doctor: 24 hours\n",
            "Patient: Basically, something is happening 24 hours and there's no like dinner breaks or anything or any breaks built-in. So everything just feels like really I don't know. I guess it feels like more people you're kind of wiry. Everybody seems everyone seems kind of wiry and jittery and like a lot really quickly. But yeah, I mean, I definitely like was way more annoyed at people and are easier than I think I've ever been at say like Wiz con or one of the other cons I do. Like it's weird that I'm still sort of on the fence about it. Was it a good use of my time? I guess I think I'll just say if I didn't go I probably spend the whole weekend being depressed about it. If I didn't go and being like huh, but also going wasn't entirely great and the other thing was so due to some poor planning or timing on my part or whatever I end up. I wanted to leave the convention and run to my apartment Sunday evening. And so first I went to a friend's house. We were going to have dinner and someone was going to drop me off at my house and it didn't end up happening until later and they were really exhausted. So I was like, okay, I'll stay the night. And it's these friends of mine, and Damian who house is borderline hoarder house and it makes me super stressed partially their stuff piled everywhere and is really not places to sit and reminds me of an ex who had very similar piles and piles and piles and piles of stuff. But I like I would have skipped like I would have rather skip going over there for dinner, even though I did end up having a great opportunity to hang out with my friend Wanda for a couple of hours and blah blah blah.\n",
            "Doctor: really annoying\n",
            "Patient: yeah, the hoarder House part just always makes me like\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you just said you just had been over crowded all weekend. I think.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, and then having the kind of pick your way around the big piles of stuff and then they decided to get for kittens recently, which\n",
            "Doctor: PetSmart kittens\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, the only have two now they're getting two more and all I could think of is that's the worst idea ever. Also their apartment has wall-to-wall cream rugs. Yeah. I'm like this is not going to go well in the room where the kittens are right now. It's already like just grossed. It's covered in black cat hair and yeah, the other thing which is not related to me being angry at a sycon is a managed to I don't even know not noticed that the new semester had started for school. Yeah, and it started last week. So that's not too bad. But never actually done that I've gotten close by doing that makes me I sat down I think Friday and was like, oh the semester started well, fuck it. I'm not going to do anything with it this weekend and then I was like, okay, I'll sit down Monday and work on it and then didn't want to and then today I was just like, oh don't want to again. I'm part of it was I really miss calculated how so? So what to get together this weekend long something about multimedia stuff. It's kind of a conference in my library. So there's like keynote each day with a catered lunch like a bag lunch and workshops are discussions running every day. So it's like two workshops in the morning an hour-and-a-half keynote at noon and then afternoon Workshop, some are just talks Summer Jams on and so, you know, like I'm just completely not involved with it wasn't asked wasn't anything which like on the one hand. I don't like working with him either. I find a both insulting and kind of baffling you really just doesn't like Suppose been really stressed about it, but hasn't asked me for any help. I offered to help he was just kind of like so it feels frustrating and insulting and I'm also a little bit glad that I don't have to deal with it. But I guess part of the first rayshun is that people have been asking me lately? Oh, yeah that thing with your department that your Department's doing. Yep, I'm not involved. It's technically not my department. It's technically another group that's half of my apartment. And then I got reminded that the main multi media site at the doesn't list me as a member of the department. Yeah, let's turn multimedia consultants and Carl and Chet and then someone who doesn't work for the library and then some other people I'm just like what? Okay, the keto today was a postdoc of African-American studies and the sort of title was storytelling and African diaspora and African-Americans and multimedia. So I was pretty excited initially. They were supposed to have this other Professor who's amazing who has done data visualization about Haitian slave revolt and that was just super amazing and he's very interesting just so you know, I go trip in for the keynote and the postdoc is this white woman that I met before and I was just like, okay. This is a little weird. Maybe there was very low attendance and I was the only black person in the room and I feel like maybe there were two people who are white that also aren't US citizens if that makes sense from from Malaysian libraries. I'm just sort of like in the postdoc being white wouldn't necessarily have been a problem on its own and certainly met her before but it just all coalesced into me feeling really frustrated and uncomfortable and not being able to leave easily because her talk she was being filmed so\n",
            "Doctor: I see there would have been feeling of you getting up and walking out. I see.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's just like, you know, I wish I had my laptop and then I could use the internet parts of what she was talking about. Her talk was disorganized and a lot of things part of what she was talking about was the African American studies sophomore seminars where they learn about how to do community outreach and how to do anthropological studies and interviews and blah blah blah. So it felt very weird to have a white woman telling presumably mostly black students how to study and talk to black people in the end that was kind of like the none of it. I was like, I was just like this very uncomfortable.\n",
            "Doctor: I would imagine. It was not touched at all also part of her. In part of her top she was discussing. A lot of for African-American African students didn't do a whole lot with technology under under represented in the tech field. And that's true. The tech field is very white. Your comment was it's because they're not be encouraged to go into Tech and we don't see it as a possibility and we just need to be encouraged and I thought no that's not really actually the problem. The problem is systemic racism, but sure. You mean through both educational system in the technology field in particular?\n",
            "Patient: Right, you know when reason I'm going to end up being sort of circular and it's similar to thoughts of like why are there a lot of women in it while they get harassed and it's really frustrating or seem to be inferior and they don't get hired. So why would you do that? I found her idea that just in couraging them through a sophomore seminar is fixing the problem to be incredibly naive.\n",
            "Doctor: ironically Sophomoric, yeah.\n",
            "Patient: She's like one person's decided to do a secondary like to start CS computer science classes, so they can create a startup. I'm like computer science classes and startups have nothing to do with each other, which is probably part of why I didn't want to do anything with my class today also.\n",
            "Doctor: You mean because of how you're feeling from that?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and also, I mean a lot of what she was talking about. I was like that's what I did as an undergrad in folklore and mythology some of these things that she was talking about.\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry, did you see your undergrad in?\n",
            "Patient: No sew some of the things she's talking about are things that I did as an undergrad in folklore and mythology. So like going out into the community and collecting stories and interviewing people.\n",
            "Doctor: OIC yes, that makes sense.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So like Anthropologie.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, so part of me was like I already know what you're talkin about. The other part of me is thinking what you're describing as being really Innovative. Is it so part of her this is so amazing and Innovative voice recording people on film. Well digital film. I was just kind of like I want to tell you film exist and it has for a while and it's interesting that they students try to turn them into videos, except they didn't do it very well. So that was kind of weird and then she had a whole about updating Wikipedia because Wikipedia doesn't have a lot of information about Africa African culture African diaspora type stuff and I think to me that was the only interesting part that's actually good because everyone uses Wikipedia for information again, there was something they were updating then another editor had been reverting. There was a little sort of tussle over something and right now says that the tussle had to do with one editor being more religious and conservative and that was what was causing the tussle, but I think the problem actually had to do it at least part Ethiopian politics and has been blamed for various bits of corruption or balance or there was something going on there. I was also wondering you know, who's that? It's regarding it. Are they Ethiopian? Are they not who's writing this are they be open or not and also asking one source for information and taking that as this is the truth, which we will update Wikipedia with is not really a great practice.\n",
            "Doctor: Brewster here was really quite naive incompetent and kind of offensive to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like you're a postdoc at Cambridge but African come on and I'm kind of like part of me is like did you get him handed this last-minute? Were you not initially supposed to speak? Is this a failure to prepare? Do you really not understand the racial politics? Are you just not talking about them because you don't want to be controversial.\n",
            "Doctor: this may be very naive on my part. But I would imagine a white person and African American studies would have thought that would have thought about or like have had to deal with being comfortable talking about that kind of stuff. I mean clearly not or something.\n",
            "Patient: I would think that accept that I think having a lot of white people who've done afro am chord just for I don't know I guess it seems like they just feel like what? Yeah, that's the truth. And also they feel like in their head. They're like, well I can tell whether or not something is racialized and if I don't think it is then it's not as opposed to like, huh? I should talk to someone else. Maybe my own whiteness is preventing me from seeking something seeing something.\n",
            "Doctor: Right and they won't necessarily learn better, I guess.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean it's also possible to do. I'm curious what she studying what she\n",
            "Doctor: Actually does yeah.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, they're definitely people who have done things like focus on the Harlem Renaissance the literature of the Harlem Renaissance and then completely skip over the politics behind the Renaissance. I'm like, okay, I guess people do that like in literature departments and stuff, but it feels very Someone in the English Department just focusing on the Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance ignoring politics making more sense than someone and afro and doing that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I can see that too. Although even just in literature by the time you're a postdoc you think that you can't get away with purely looking at the internal structure of the books. You're reading or something like that. I don't really know.\n",
            "Patient: It was just a part of me is like, I don't know. Maybe she's dumbing it down for the audience or like parsley. It just seems baffling.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm wondering about an answer to this might just be know is are you doing that thing at all? Where I mean when somebody pisses you off. You tend to be a little more critical. You know what I'm thinking about story that the Cambridge Business review story. I'm not sure all the all of us what's going on, but it did cross my mind to ask.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not that I don't believe you believe she could be that bad. I just\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean the part of the there was an overall issue of there was some incoherence to her talk with someone else mentioned. So like okay, it's not just me but I think you're definitely I had a hard time listening like she was supposed to talk about something like part of teaching them how to do these interviews. She's like well teach them how to get to Roxbury on the bus. I'm like really that's a weird statement.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Also among the other things in that statement. It's like the Cambridge students not taking the bus not knowing how to get to a part area of town or areas where there's black people. There's a whole lot going on with that statement. And so I was thinking about that when she was sort of going on talking about something some other things at various point where I was just like, but how did you just say that so\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah what I might have caught as well probably not but I think I get what you mean. That's not like there's a lot going on there that's reflective of her point of view.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, and also since I'm already familiar with the subject, basically, it's quite possible that if I was less familiar with it, although a co-worker of mine did comment on the bus to Roxbury thing without any prompting so\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, the more I think about it, that's really\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was just kind of weird.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: So I'll so it's going to be a whole week of this and I plan to be supportive and show my face and now I'm thinking, you know, I don't have to do that, especially since like, so there's been super low turnout people in the building haven't bothered to show so I think I\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you're done.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, okay. I was going to continue thinking on your comment of Cuz I just getting super critical because I was mad.\n",
            "Doctor: I wouldn't go so far as to say you were just being super critical because you were mad. I was wondering if that was a piece of it. You know what I mean? I don't doubt that. She had the problems you describe. I have the sense that from the incident. Sometimes you push you push a little further and make a person more ridiculous. That's what I'm wondering about, but I don't know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know either but it's a big item to think of.\n",
            "Doctor: In a good way or not a good way.\n",
            "Patient: In a good way.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry, I'm late.\n",
            "Patient: That's okay. Things are not too good. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I keep thinking things will get better things. Just don't get better. So\n",
            "Doctor: Let me change the subject and ask you something trivial because otherwise I'm going to immediately forget about it which a scheduling question. Could you switch least for awhile to 9:15 from 8:30 on Wednesday?\n",
            "Patient: yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Alright. What's happened since last night?\n",
            "Patient: Not much. I don't know I think a lot about killing myself and I'm not sure I have the courage.\n",
            "Doctor: To do it or not to do it.\n",
            "Patient: to do it Yeah. Yeah, that's one way out.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I'm aware that there are sort of practical considerations, but for the moment, let's put those aside and do business as usual as usual.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Which will come back to them later today. But yeah, I imagine you're telling me now both of your safety and about what's on your mind.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. It just seems like there's no good way out of this.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I have some thoughts.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: The first is as usual. I think I don't doubt your at all the sort of I don't know pain and horror and feeling trapped in the fear that you felt started yesterday afternoon. I guess either except for being asleep that you felt until now at the same time. There are some things that are a little suspicious.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You do seem to have a pretty syrup to have pretty Surly forgotten and I imagine maybe unconsciously gotten rid of how you felt. Let me for example on Friday other times too. But that was just the time we talked about it. So which was considered considered Peru, we better and also since the beginning of black Fleet Week, very cautiously and Berry where we're really hopeful.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think what's going on now is just what you are feeling like OSHA. I kind of crashed again. And so the hopes I had were dashed. I don't think this is just that that would semen seem reasonable to me, but I don't think that's what's going on. Actually that I think it's likely that you have kind of gotten rid of what that felt like all together.\n",
            "Patient: happy\n",
            "Doctor: I mean this isn't like oh things are going a bit better. But now I've had a setback so I'm kind of feeling worse about things and not as hopeful or optimistic as I was I think this is like that's gone in the I don't know quite what to call it. Like the horror the depression isn't quite right suicide isn't quite right suicidality the phrase that occurs to me is like it is back with a vengeance I think and it has obliterated what came before\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I was feeling hopeful.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I want that back.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you may be punishing yourself for having felt it.\n",
            "Patient: Why would it?\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not saying that it's going to make you feel hopeful again. But I think the model you kind of have kind of have of it to the extent that you have a model at all in the weighted. It was kind of sounded to me last night. Was it almost like it was quite biological. Like, you know or that's not quite right like something that some like something like that though. We're once you're out of the environment of the hospital or whatever like basically would be more like this these things just come to you. There's no Rhyme or Reason. They undo whatever could possibly be done in only imaginal way to feel any better is to be dead. Like it's the plague. I mean you get to play cure. Fuck. Yeah, maybe like being a hospital bed and to get some fluids or something. But basically you get the plague. You're fucked your dad. Now, you're dead later. You're going to suffer in the meantime and that's it. There's nothing really to be done. My impression. Is that. That's what it felt like but again actually look at it. Look at what has happened. That's not really what it looks like. We don't know ultimately if the ECT is going to make a significant difference. I mean it was for a week and a half. It's seems pretty clear along with being in the hospital. I always makes a difference. So it's hard to tell from what's what and hard to know how often these will come back with ECT. We don't know but though they're uncertain but there is uncertainty uncertainty their butt and he have your conviction that there is no real possible help Everest. I mean when I say it is a little I imagine you know what I mean.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: wherever this is something we've run into before the feeling of a kind of inevitable of mono and monolithic quality of to the depression, especially this suicidality in a way that emerges little later I like\n",
            "Patient: Not closer to quite adding up.\n",
            "Doctor: Or not quite fitting like I guess there has been times where it's before where it's very much felt that way and we sort of look back at why what's happening there were actually clear precipitous. And it doesn't make the horror of feeling this way any better, but it does sort of contextualize it a little bit.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I think this is I think this has that too. I think the context is probably like a kind of guilty and then full reaction to feeling better at least in part or being taken care of.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You know, maybe now I'm clearly on a roll here. Maybe maybe you know, you said when we talked on the phone, but you you were talking about getting help and you said this was after you were start starting to feel a little bit better in the hospital anywhere. Like now I'm kind of kind of feel like I have to leave I feel a little better. I don't feel like I deserve it anymore. I feel guilty about getting now I should just be out of here. And you said that in kind of a self-conscious way of knowing that it was still perfectly reasonable for you to be in the hospital, but I think you were saying look I'm completely desperate I either don't care anymore. Somehow it's okay to get the help. And then after I sort of am a little sort of an some little amount away from that actually it wasn't a little mount. It was hard to remember feeling that way when you were out of it. But anyways point is once you're feeling well enough to possibly not need that anymore and made you feel guilty to have And I don't know maybe this is a real reaction to that guilt. Maybe you do feel guilty for Ever Getting It you sort of suspend that for a while when things are awful. And then when you feel better or you go home and falls on you like a ton of bricks.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And this sort of Thoroughly cruising way that obliterates your recollection of things ever in better, whatever help or optimism. You may have had however guarded or weary. And it is terrible terrible terrible. But what happened to you?\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: That's also not to say that I know that you'll survive this. I don't I hope so, but I really I don't know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't either. You know I intend to but the hopelessness is just it's so convincing. Yeah, it really is just gone. And I don't remember it at all.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, you pointed it out to me and I sort of remember it but not really. It's like it was it wasn't even there.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. Do you almost feel that impulse to make it clear to me that it wasn't even there?\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: How would you like to to explain it? I mean, this is a genuine question. I'm not trying to set you up. I really want to know.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know just feels like it clearly wasn't real.\n",
            "Doctor: Like you were probably taken in.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And I'll probably taking it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Now you see it like it is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And I imagine you feel so sure.\n",
            "Patient: And I very much want to give up and want not to give up. I don't know. It's really hard.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, what's the part about wanting to give up? It is almost like a u x that you were folded pulled into having hope and made things worse.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Is like you don't know how you're going to bear it for the minute let alone for years to come.\n",
            "Patient: I can I can do it for the next minute. Yeah, I can verify this chunk of time. Just not much longer. It's just really Graham.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, I don't mean to be in any way critical abuse Amos. I know you're working incredibly hard and that all this takes so much effort and takes so much out of the my thought at this moment is this is a little bit like when you saw a therapist as a kid\n",
            "Patient: How so?\n",
            "Doctor: And you were you were terrified that the therapist would find out that you were depressed and wanted to I guess talk about anything but and I kind of have a different assualt of a very different perspective on that which is that there is there was something very dangerous about the possibility of getting the help that you were sort of desperate to protect yourself. There's a way of that which I guess I sort of assumed before and I thought was that what you meant that you were afraid that if you were labeled depressed that somehow that wouldn't turn out well for you. First of all, a therapist clearly was not going to help second of all it would be something bad for you like your dad or your mom or whomever knowing this about you so it could only go badly. And I guess what I'm imagining now is maybe there was something something kind of more fundamental and sort of more terrifying about somebody someone finding out how you really felt what you really saw it and it was really like that you were being in a relationship with somebody who really knew those things about you was for some reason. I kind of got your possibilities, but I'm not sure which it is really dangerous.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, it feels like it but I don't know why.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so I mean to be clear I don't at all think you are sitting here like stinking all this stuff that you're consciously withholding from me. I don't have that and I think you've shared what comes to mind but I do think that unclog unconsciously. You're pretty in the head visit inhibited from thinking of things to say about what it's really like in a context. You're not generally at all lost for words or ways of talking thinking about or describing. So those things I imagine that might be why\n",
            "Patient: Yeah about it.\n",
            "Doctor: It's okay. I mean I imagine that the level of it probably makes you feel bad. We talked about that but you really wish like you probably feel like you're going to meet me at the service something before.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And maybe go back through some of what I don't know where about you yourself in some other way. Maybe you're terrified and feel like no good could possibly come from having more to say\n",
            "Patient: I'm afraid I'm not going to make it.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you ever want to do you ever want to feel what's going to happen?\n",
            "Patient: I'm afraid I'll kill myself. I don't know not really to get Ethan.\n",
            "Doctor: but safe\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You just won't be able to things you want.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you won't care so much about whatever courage it takes, but how bad things are hurting?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It will just be.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it would be the best thing that I never did.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep, I remember and you don't want to go back to the hospital.\n",
            "Patient: No, I have to.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not asking because it's going to be your decision. I'm asking because I at least consider taking into account what you want could but yeah, I mean if you were saying I would just feel so much better. If I was back there I would think about it, but you're at the moment saying you prefer prefer prefer.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So obviously you're quite scared.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: and pretty helpless\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Is there any plan for the day?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think I will the stuff our stuff out of storage. So I have to have some unpacking to do. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and I have a question about the ECT and you may not remember this actually, do you know when it's about how full and now it is? Not at all the kind of assumed it helps kind of soon after the treatment itself or there was kind of a\n",
            "Patient: I think it.\n",
            "Doctor: More like it an SSRI where you would just sort of Build It Up over time, you know as opposed to like adderal. Will you kind of get a the Boost right away?\n",
            "Patient: I think I want to say it was helpful soon after the treatment itself.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's not easy for me to tell.\n",
            "Doctor: Mostly because it's hard to remember imagine that anything actually help.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I guess my inclination is to send you home and ask you to leave some kind of message a little later this afternoon to let me know where things are at. Obviously if you need to call me before that, you can but kind of at least let me know no late afternoon kind of where things are at and whether they're worse or the same or better.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I can do that.\n",
            "Doctor: And then I mean we're scheduled tomorrow morning then you have treatment tomorrow.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: All right.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's alright, you know my thought is just to kind of see what happens with that. But that actually makes a difference or not.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: What kind of go from there but obviously it seems get worse or get even more dangerous, you know. Do you have any other thoughts about the plan?\n",
            "Patient: I think I can wait.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: All right will let me stop for now.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: How did things work out? I've got your message, obviously after.\n",
            "Patient: I know you are very helpful. Thank you for taking time to call me.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: So Ivan said he was fine that night that he didn't need to go anywhere and that so he didn't do anything further. He did say I was hoping you wouldn't find that so we did make the distinction that he was saving it actively.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: It wasn't something that he forgot about which I was really hoping it was because that's really common for him. But it wasn't and we saw dr. Farrow SP Friday. Obviously, it wasn't very helpful. And I guess I something I tried to convey to her which I'm not sure she understood not communicating directly. You are maybe she doesn't understand. I feel like I need more help. I feel like I need I don't know what she takes. I don't know what it should look like but it's been it's really become a lot to take care of him on some level and to be responsive to the way things are going with his depression and such without any additional help because I feel like it's really helpful to me with you, but that's 45 minutes out of the week. Then my sister is there always listening but I feel bad like putting that on her cuz then she's really worried. I don't like going I don't like doing that and that's kind of where it ends because my parents aren't so able I guess and talkin Ivan's dad was a really bad experience. So I guess she's like you need someone to come in and help you with the apartment. I'm like no.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I wonder what you're picturing when you say I need more help. What looks what would help.\n",
            "Patient: In theory, I think it would come from our sets of parents and Theory it would be someone who could be calling them and checking up and finding out what's going on and be really like I'm bored with this treatment plan and I don't know if I should call that but maybe for me somebody who's able to call and just how's it going? It seems pretty clear. It's not going to come for my parents, which is fine. And dr. Farrow said do not call his dad. I think it's more emotional support. I think it's more I'm having a really really tough time is mood swings seem to be more pronounced. Egos for my crying to really happy hyper attentive towards me you guys really back and forth back and forth, which I understand part of depression. I shouldn't expect it to be different. I'm not criticizing the fact that he's going through that but I'm just acknowledging its really tough.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a lot on you.\n",
            "Patient: Right now I'm really worried about the threats in the note and I'm very worried about it obviously, but I'm also again it sounds horribly selfish. But I've taken a moment and realizing that this is really tough to deal with I'm not doing it completely alone obviously, but it feels like sometimes when I'm not when I'm not here\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I'm the only other person in the apartment and it's too much and it's affecting me physically and it's affecting me emotionally and sometimes I feel myself being really pulled down in his when the moves are really impressive and it's really hard to like try to bring him up because I'm like, so it's getting really difficult to manage.\n",
            "Doctor: What if the dilemmas is that you articulate what you wish you had that would that would help for as a parent who is more supportive both of you you wish that only for your own parents to be people who they are not but his parrot sounds like that also is a piece of what we may have thought clear after your exchange with Ivan's dad that he has tremendous deficits also as a parent.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I've talked to my sister a little afterwards like the next couple days or whatever and I told her what had gone on and she's like, well, he's reacting like a dad. He's emotional. He can't it's unfortunate. He couldn't step out to help you but you felt like it went back to his he and Ivan are more friends than anything which is I don't know how I feel about that. But I mean he was not at all able to be it wasn't like an initial hysteria and then he calm down like he had a plan. No.\n",
            "Doctor: So he was hysterical on the phone.\n",
            "Patient: He wasn't like stopping and but he was really emotional and he was very clear that he wanted me to talk or to call doctor bored and find out what I should be doing differently and how I should be taking care of it. He's like do not call and ask what I've been needs to be doing find out what you need to be doing. I'm sure he meant I'm sure it never occurred to him.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm not.\n",
            "Patient: That sounded really accusing but he said I don't know if this is around the time you went home to get your car inspected, but I don't know if I even if it sounded like you didn't want him to go. I want don't want to get in the middle of that. But so we just kind of let me know that he thought it was me kind of astounded accusatory to me and he called me back after a while cuz he couldn't wait to hear if I had gotten hold of dr. Word and he's telling me that Ivan has had some struggles with this before. He's like Ivan doesn't know it but he wrote a poem and 7th grade and his teacher called me because it was dark and I wanted to say why didn't you do anything? Why didn't you but all I said was I feel like it's clearly in grad school even a little before I haven't needed some help with this and you didn't get it. There are some big things. I'd like to know when really see his struggle with attention or memory or he's like no, that's all he's been here. Whenever I mention I said that. I said I said someone I didn't want to bring in that I'm seeing someone intimate but I said one of them said that it might be helpful for Ivan to get some kind of evaluation to find out what's going on and maybe even a pharmaceutical evaluation and just I told him I didn't know if he was aware but Ivan feels that this is very big matized and he's very disappointed in himself. If that would, you made that very clear. I said, I don't know if there's a way that you could somehow approach him and let him know that you guys support it and you don't you know, there is no Stigma and its healthy kids really couldn't You really couldn't get that maybe cuz I'm like, I know you told Ivan at one point he needs to be on antidepressants and I said maybe you don't do that. I said, you know, you're not really it's not really your field and even if it was you are his dad and you are so close to this. He's like, well, I did take a lot of psychology course. I'm just I'm sorry. I can't get past that. I'm so angry at him. He's a pastor. He went to Seminary like he's not major in Psychology event. He has no what is honestly on the phone telling me how 20 years he took a couple classes, and I'm just like\n",
            "Doctor: Did he call Ivan or did Ivan's mom call Ivan?\n",
            "Patient: haha\n",
            "Doctor: No one called him.\n",
            "Patient: I know everybody's acting like nothing ever happened and Martin was very clear on the phone. He's like this conversation never happened and you till you hear from doctor. I don't think you should confront Ivan. I told him I didn't know what to do here. And I was hoping he really just kind of told me to just so is unfortunate and he kind of gave me like a short list of what he needed and he never called me back not even to check like how's it going? I think that's his way of so I understand Ivan maybe avoids him sometimes and maybe he'll learn that a little bit at home.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm just really.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I think that could be one of the things that for you right now is most anxiety-provoking about not only finding the note but then to discover in the whole system of your life your shared life with Ivan that neither of you has a set of parents or even a single parent who you can turn to for some guidance and support through all this and that's devastating.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe tell my sister said what about Julie? Maybe his mother is a bit more. She's definitely a bit more or less emotional unless mainly talking but the problem is I'm very intimidated by her. So I'm kind of scared to call and I'm really worried that I it can go as badly as it did with Ivan's dad or worse and I really again this sounds really selfish, but I really can't deal with her blaming me cuz I already feel like there is already suggesting me saying you need to have a job or you need to like that makes him feel worthless or that makes him feel which is difficult.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, one of the things that's hard. I mean, dr. Farah said that she does experience a dynamic in the room get so polarized. We are holding this kind of rage and criticizing criticism and he's holding all the shame and kind of recoiling. I think that the thing I would be pushing you guys to start getting out there and understanding together is that I don't think you're the only one which region criticism in the room and I don't think he's the only one with shame in the room and me anxiety.\n",
            "Patient: No, no.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you carry around tremendous Shame about your own family your own experiences. The problem is that you just both deal with it in opposite ways. He puts his head in the sand and you kind of do a very opposite obsessional organizing cleaning organizing cleaning organizing cleaning. So you take it almost as a critical attack and he takes it with the withdrawal the problem is that right now as long as you're in that place is going to stay in this place, you know, and if the couple's work is going to help you it's going to be able to help you come back to not feeling is responsible for him not feeling sort of letting go of your criticize them criticism for the for the time being and him to start to grab some more of his own self criticism going to put his own agency initiative. I think one of the problems in what's getting clear in this family system though, is that you both have Set the parents who kind of rainforest these ways of being in the world and a find the Ivans dad. For example, here's what his son wrote a suicide letter and doesn't want to doesn't want Call Him a Cowboy that he is. That's how much he sticks his own head in the sand. You know, that's extraordinary. Told you not to confront him about it. And this is how much things got pushed under the rug in this family and still to this day. He can't be a responsible appropriate parent around and appropriate parent would have been to call him and say I need to let you know. I know this I'm so concerned about you. What can we as parents do to help you with this and that's absent so it's all the more infuriating for you. The problem is what if that's what you're going to get. What if that's who they are.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I really again I keep trying to emphasize the doctor Fair out cuz I feel like this has been really clearing me for a while. Is that I really need something more and it's not so she's like do you need to see my doctor McNally more? Do you need someone to help you clean the apartment? Do you need I don't know that those are and then she immediately from there went to separation which right now I don't feel good about and I don't want to do but I don't know if it's a parent. This is really difficult yesterday. I had to listen to him tell me how it's inevitable. We're going to get divorced and couples therapy. I have to listen to him say this is hopeless. It's never going to get any better and I have to find a way to not only get upset and not have any emotions surrounding that and not take a minute to go cry or call someone or take care of myself. I need to turn around and say like what can we do to help you tell me it's really difficult.\n",
            "Doctor: And you have all this feeling that bubbles up about how he could do that from your own childhood.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: You've done that your whole life.\n",
            "Patient: I'm tired, and I don't know what doctor Pharaoh says. She thought it seemed like she perceived me as being almost like stuck in the 90s. Like I'm really doing it all over and it feels that way to an extent but honest to goodness it more. Maybe this is just me not being aware of but it really feels like I really do did do it growing up and I really did do it even in college like every summer and now I really am doing it with my spouse and so\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Okay. So one of the things we have to I think get clear about in reality is his parents are not going to be parents to him in the way you want them to be.\n",
            "Patient: Should I try to talk to Julie? Is that a?\n",
            "Doctor: That may be an option is to try it. But who knows? I don't know her, you know her better than I do for sure. I don't know what kind of response she'll have. That might be then the next step is something you could try if you're being practical but if she responds in a similar way, it's that question than what if there are not going to be parents. We're going to help them either side will your parents?\n",
            "Patient: My mom is apparently still not talking to me for two weeks ago when I asked about Easter, so I am not sometimes she can be really helpful and other times around like she's really not not a good situation and my dad doesn't do any type of emotional discussion.\n",
            "Doctor: What would happen if you called him?\n",
            "Patient: You would tell me I'm really sorry to hear that. Let me know if there's anything I can do you would care to talk about feelings is not something he does and he would really take the you know, I'm really cross that Ivan didn't get a job or he needs to be working you and take the very practical like you someone who doesn't take care of his own house. So I mean he's worried about me. If anything. He's pretty disappointed. I think with the way Ivan has been.\n",
            "Doctor: But what so what's missing he would ever response in the moment. That was empathetic. It sounds like he would say, I'm sorry, but he wouldn't be able to be to offer more of something. Is that what you're looking for? Like somebody who's going to\n",
            "Patient: I don't know, but I'm\n",
            "Doctor: Because nobody's going to be able to fix this situation.\n",
            "Patient: No, no, I'm not expecting a sex but what I'm saying is that I feel pretty overwhelmed and everyday truly yesterday. You went from crap all the way through church afterwards telling me how we're getting a divorce then at lunch like nothing ever happened happy and then later in the evening like crying a little bit again and then up and down and then up again and it is so sharp and it's so actually doing and I can't I can't even tell him this is going on or that I'm struggling at this because he's totally unaware. He's in his own. He's also doing a little bit of it feels pretty manipulative and my sister said that sounds really intentional. I don't know but she's doing things like a walk time 4:30 a.m. Shift at Starbucks and I'm like, why would you do that? Like that doesn't even make sense to take the car. That's so silly. It's a 10 minute drive. Why would you even though no pity party so upset about it? And of course I kept saying no, of course not I feel like those comments are meant to elicit a lot of sympathy. What should I do? And then the next night when it was Play snowing is it okay if I take the car tomorrow morning? He's really doing that alot. It's happening another I can go without health insurance for a couple months until it kicks in. I'm like, why are we even going to have this conversation? It's so absurd and he knows it's absurd and I feel it's very clear that he denies. He's like, I'm not manipulating you I'm not trying to get any kind of sympathy but he'll throw pity party like like I don't need health insurance. I can walk like really extreme and of course I respond very warmly lovingly sympathetically and he wants that and it's really frustrating because again, I feel really alone and taking care of all this and it is a lot all day every day and night still breaking out in hives in the whole thing.\n",
            "Doctor: So if you're not ready to get separated one of the things I think we really need to help you do more is to learn for right now to not be as responsible for him.\n",
            "Patient: It's impossible.\n",
            "Doctor: Cuz as your language comes out Ramona every single thing you're saying is that it's as though he's your parent and you're saying I have to take care of him and I have to be kind then I have to coax him out of that. Then I have to do this you sound like you need more protection right now from playing that role and anything and everything we can do to help you not play that role anymore. It doesn't mean being extremely angry, but it just might mean saying stepping out of the of scenarios in which you feel drawn into take care of him. Just not doing that. What do you mean when you say it's impossible?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think anyone gets what's going on? Because quite honestly he sits in a couples therapy and says I can take care of myself. I've got it under control and then dr. Farrell turns to me and says you need to start taking him at his word. No understand. Then when we go home and Ivan continues to say that you can take care of himself sometimes but he's not taking care of himself.\n",
            "Doctor: When you say that, what's happening is he not getting to work?\n",
            "Patient: Like you didn't have a schedule for this week. You didn't and I'm like, okay you need to call this morning and you need to get that.\n",
            "Doctor: So that's what you need to not do anymore. Well, that's your responsibility though. That's not his responsibility. That's more symptom.\n",
            "Patient: I can't I can't that's like the bear him do the word think that is embarrassing. I need to have happen from him right now.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, but that's not your responsibility. What are you afraid of?\n",
            "Patient: I need to be able to get groceries. I need to be able to pay the bills.\n",
            "Doctor: So you don't believe he'll get to work if you don't get his schedule.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I mean we had a pretty big fight before he would call for it for his very first week. Like something is really seriously wrong when someone doesn't care if they have their work schedule.\n",
            "Doctor: Actually, I know a lot of people who call at the last minute get their schedule and function just fine.\n",
            "Patient: After a month of not having a job.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, I'm not saying that's ideal. I'm totally with you on the way you're doing. It is more appropriate. But this is the kind of thing you we need to help you even for one month. Not you're taking on being his mother.\n",
            "Patient: You just keep saying I don't want that. I don't need that. I don't want that. I don't need that. No one is there to see that? He can't do it on his own.\n",
            "Doctor: But you don't let him try so we don't see what will happen. If you don't do that. Do you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Remind me Tuesday morning. I woke up and we had warm food because he couldn't remember to close the fridge. I mean we woke up in the car battery was dead because he couldn't remember to turn off the light. I mean he's been using shampoo to wash his body for over a month because he can't remember to take his new bar of soap into the shower. I mean things actually happen that affect me so it's not like we've been down the road I can let it go or said I should let it go and it just falls on him and maybe he'll learn consequences the whole it doesn't happen. He doesn't get worked up about the consequences I do and they affect me too.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, see you sound like you're at your wits and Ramona. If you're saying you can't not let some of these things go for a month. Do you know what I mean? But this is that important for example, what if you were two separate I don't mean to force. I don't mean we're in a separation. I just mean the living you went and lived with your sister for a month or something like that or he went and got his own apartment for a month.\n",
            "Patient: It can't happen.\n",
            "Doctor: Why?\n",
            "Patient: I don't dr. Ferro try to say something like that. She got creative. I don't know if I don't mean to say you're not aware, but I can't just move in with my sister. She has a one-room like studio type thing on the top floor of a house and they don't turn on the heat and I have a cat and I go to school and she lives in Newton and I have stuff and I would have to be on their list.\n",
            "Doctor: When I say that, I'm not suggesting that that might be the exact scenario.\n",
            "Patient: There is now it would involve one of us finding another place. Probably unless I live with my sister and there is now I don't think anyone is scaring me. Like I need him to get the schedule because I need him to be able to pay our rent if you don't have money for another.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think you're hearing me that you're asking me for something that can't happen in reality then.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know what I mean? I hear you wanting something that's not going to exist for you. So we have to work within the limits of what is possible in reality and figure out which option is best for you to hear what I'm saying? Are you sure I hear how bad it is Ramona? I did a lot of talking to doctor Pharaoh from your eyes so that she understands. It sounds like she doesn't quite understand how bad it is and I try to tell her these these kinds of things you tell her all of this.\n",
            "Patient: It's really hard. I feel like she doesn't get it. I feel like she blames me. She criticizes me and I feel like she says we need to deal with your anger and resentment and that we never talked about Ivan's depression. I feel like she tries to counselors like we are both. I don't know how to say this. I feel like she tries to counselors like Ivan isn't depressed and having mood swings and having problems with memory things like that never enters the room. I feel so it's like super callous because you can't expect the same result.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I can't get\n",
            "Doctor: So maybe one of the things would be helpful is for me to talk to her again to clarify a little bit more. Even you're adding these bullet points of things that are happening to make sure that she hears that loudly and clearly about just what continues to be going on things like this out that's minor in the grand scheme of things. Like that would be the kind of thing. I'd say to you see if you can\n",
            "Patient: doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: Go buy another shampoo for a dollar find a cheaper shampoo. You can buy it hide it so he doesn't use that one and use that one yourself the car. That's a different story The fridges a different story the things that start to up the level of impact in your daily life has mood swings. This is where I also think like even you're not going to separate separate spaces right now how to develop some space for you. Even if you're going to be living in the same space how to say you won't then spend the evening together, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: What is not working? Because I've tried We have basically two rooms. We have the bedroom. We have the living room dining room. We have an open kitchen and the bathroom and the patio.\n",
            "Doctor: So what do you want to happen? Then? What are you hoping someone will tell you to do.\n",
            "Patient: I'm hoping that someone well, I don't know. All I know is I really need more help because it's really exhausting and really like\n",
            "Doctor: What is more help look like? What kind of help do you need?\n",
            "Patient: I need someone.\n",
            "Doctor: To do what?\n",
            "Patient: You need to listen Maybe to stay at the end of the day say like oh your husband told you you're going to get a divorce. That's really. I'm sorry, this is so stupid.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not stupid, Ramona.\n",
            "Patient: It's not that big of a deal. I'm just a little I guess I need to someone to say that's really difficult. I'm here for you. Just something or it must be really tough to listen to him. Say how hopeless it is and keep going but I'm here for you and I hear that and you're not crazy and you're not going to make it up and it's okay to get upset about that or you found a suicide note today. Oh my gosh, let me listen or let me come over and just hang out with you. I don't know something but frankly quite frankly. I have you and I have my sister and I'm even reluctant. I told her about the note and stuff which I didn't want to do, but I really need to have somebody.\n",
            "Doctor: Of course you did.\n",
            "Patient: But like that's the best relationship. I haven't quite honestly, she's been my caretaker when she was young because she's the oldest and I hate that she ends up she goes and she's really worried about me and then she tries to help me out in ways, but I don't want our relationship to become all about trouble in my marriage because she already listens to my mom about her problems and her marriage and my poor sister is never going to get married and I don't know I need somebody to\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like you need someone in your life understanding what you're going through and how real and how horrible and how scary this is. Just even finding a suicide note. Ramona is terribly terribly scary and overwhelming. I don't know if it felt like that didn't get honored in the couple session.\n",
            "Patient: I know we talked about it for like 5 minutes and then she's like let's move on to where we left off and I'm like no you don't get it. I can't talk about any of our problems in here because he's going to go write another note was going to make another threat or Worse. He's going to continue finding ways to hide that you tried to tell him you need to tell doctor board about these things. You need to promise that and he's like no, I don't want to tell anyone because I shouldn't be feeling this way. I don't even say that. I'm angry when I'm angry because I should be better than that and it's obscure. It's like I don't know. It's getting really really difficult and I don't.\n",
            "Doctor: You sound and I think one of the things that might help is identifying what you're feeling is right. Now. The thing that comes out most is anger. Like even at me today, you're a psychic told me is anger you sound. So underneath that Ramona terrified.\n",
            "Patient: Cuz I want him I just can't do this anymore. Like I can't do this for five more seconds on the other hand. It's okay because I need to take care of him and he needs my help right now and he's my husband and he's really struggling but it's just like you won't get the help he needs.\n",
            "Doctor: actually remote at your struggling to\n",
            "Patient: It doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: it does to me.\n",
            "Patient: It doesn't even.\n",
            "Doctor: Listen, it does to me it does matter. It does matter.\n",
            "Patient: I can't turn to my husband and say I'm having a really tough time with your mood swings. I can't do that. I can't say it really hurts me that you don't support me going to school. I can't do that. I can't.\n",
            "Doctor: What is in a couple session you said I'm terrified. I am absolutely terrified.\n",
            "Patient: Going to get more depressed. I don't think anyone I can't talk about anything that's going on that's wrong with his behavior anything that hurts me because it sent him further in the shame and guilt and depression.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not talking about wrong with his behavior. Do you hear the words that I'm saying are I'm terrified.\n",
            "Patient: What's a horrible about that?\n",
            "Doctor: That's his problem.\n",
            "Patient: No, it really does become my problem because I need to take care of him when he's writing notes and making threats and sobbing your church because we're going to get a divorce.\n",
            "Doctor: How about you don't take care of him you keep saying I need to take care of him. I need to.\n",
            "Patient: and who's going to\n",
            "Doctor: Not your problem.\n",
            "Patient: Am I have no marriage last? I have no Ivan is things are going to get worse for him.\n",
            "Doctor: I actually think you'd have more likely to have a marriage that would get saved. If you could say it's not my problem more because he will also have more likely of a marriage he's going to save the more he can say it's my problem. I got to do this. I got to miss.\n",
            "Patient: But he's not going to he's not willing to take the steps to part of depression is he doesn't want help. He doesn't want to talk about it. You would rather swim something and yell then say I'm angry because he should be better that. It's so extreme eating the suggestion.\n",
            "Doctor: He has a very serious personality disorder.\n",
            "Patient: Is it that?\n",
            "Doctor: On top of depression. He's depressed to what it sounds like you're responding to are the layers of the way she regulates affect and respond interpersonally that can be manipulative can be moving to extremes without being able to look at things in a more mature way. This is stuff in his personality that is in addition to being very depressed. So I think that's also part of what it feels of. What is so frustrating right now. Is that a piece of what's getting at attributed to depression actually has to do with being depressed and having a personality disorder at the same time.\n",
            "Patient: Z really have a personality disorder.\n",
            "Doctor: I think so.\n",
            "Patient: What does that I made the horrible mistake the other day saying I feel like you're two people sometimes like I feel it's a different personality. Sometimes I made a horrible mistake of that and then days later. He said you called me schizophrenic and I'm like, I never use that word Ivan like that is so\n",
            "Doctor: Which is not schizophrenic is a very different is very different. Then he would be two different people. That's totally different diagnosis. He's not schizophrenic. I don't think\n",
            "Patient: like I really want this again sounds really horrible and it sounds really selfish but I'm really desperately want him to be evaluated and I want to find out what the heck quite frankly is going on because and I want if he needs to be taking medication if you needs to be seen doctor board a couple sessions twice, I don't know I need to know and then I need to happen you yesterday. He just tells me if anyone asked him to do any kind of evaluation you'd feel so disappointed in my get where that comes around because I'm talking to his dad who says if we screwed him up we'll deal with that. That's what he said to me. I'm like what is wrong with you? No wonder I've been as a stigma with that. He hears his parents refer to it as true.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I don't.\n",
            "Doctor: It's really hard that you're going through.\n",
            "Patient: But he's going to be able to like I have no clue what's going on. Is she is he going to be able to come out of it is you going to be able to\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know for sure. I don't know him. I don't know what's going on with his treatment would I do know from talking to both? Dr. Faro Dr. Board, but they both feel he's made quite a lot of progress. So independently doctor board said he's opening up in a way. He never did in the beginning he finds more of his own feelings about actually being angry in that set in the session being upset rather than just kind of whipping himself shame. That is a that is a symptom that kind of covers up a whole lot of other stuff. Dr. Farrow said she also felt like he was really beginning to find a little bit more of a boy's she thought the two of you guys were making a lot of Headway for a while when you were being seen twice a week for a little bit until she went away on vacation and she said she felt like everything fell apart and almost felt like none of the progress that ever happened. She thought at that time was feeling quite hopeful about where the two of you were beginning to head together. So I'm saying that now because I think just to know that there's perspectives are that changes happening in him. It's not as fast maybe as you'd like it to happen, but character change personality change doesn't happen quickly. It takes years. So this is a new piece of the puzzle that doctor board didn't you didn't know even that Ivan had made threats, for example.\n",
            "Patient: I know I understand why I've been wouldn't tell someone who I can understand.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe you can understand and that it took you awhile to tell me because you were so embarrassed about it. Do you remember?\n",
            "Patient: I didn't want to I hadn't looked at his notes since I found it. I wanted it all go away. The thing is things can go really well at home. If I bring up no issues by instigate no arguments. No discussions about anything this problem that I just cooked dinner and we watch a movie and make a point of talking about things that you know, he's not going to bring it up and then things are okay, but they're not okay. So I don't know how to actually felt like saying last time that I don't want to go anymore couples therapy because it feels so it feels almost.\n",
            "Doctor: You feel like you're getting blamed.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yes. I feel like I'm getting blamed by his parents. I feel like I'm getting blame by her. I feel like if I could just deal with the anger and resentment and if I didn't speak up last time and say this is too much. I need help that you wouldn't have suggested as a separate probably would like the marriage can work if it just put it all in a drawer and I don't. I really just keep coming back. Like I want to know what's going on with him and I want to find a way to deal with it and I want to move on and I can't deal with the next five years being like this.\n",
            "Doctor: So he's in good hands. So this is more piece of it takes time getting into a relationship with a therapist to begin to sort all this out sometimes years. So that's kind of what you're up against in reality is that I can't go a lot faster. Even if Ivan were to go into the hospital for example, say he were to feel so suicidal again that doctor board to me it what feels hopeful about this is whether you and Ivan stay together or not is Ivan is now doctor board knows he knows about the letter he knows from me because you both give me permission to talk to him a little bit more about these threats. He was making it's extremely helpful to him now that he knows this because it kind of flushes out a little bit more about what's going on beneath the surface. This means that Ivan can now start to talk about some of this stuff for the first time in his life and my guess is stuff. He's kept bottled up inside. She hasn't been put into words will start getting put into words. That's all good stuff. Doctor board is an excellent therapist. He's probably one of my top three therapist in the entire city who I would refer to. He's outstanding in his intuition about people. It can't get much faster, especially or example, what's your doctor board says? Okay, Ramona. Ramona wants you to get testing. I'm going to come in and tell you we need to get tested if he does that and the poorly-timed Way Ivins going to say what and never go back to see him again. So he's got to also pays himself. Even if he agrees with you. That's a really good idea and agrees with me even with psychopharm. these are things that what I can do to keep my role as keep him informed of all the pieces that you can keep telling me to make sure he has a whole picture. I think that will help him and Ivan. It even sounds like he's giving me permission to do that. I think that will be helpful that Ivan. I don't think that's only in your best interest. I think that's in his best interest that people get the fullest picture faster. Projector boards also going to have to find a way of bringing this up in ways that are palatable and manageable for him too. And it might take some time to do that. So I might say to you if you can even until we meet next not bring anything up and I'm saying this not going to work. Your marriage is not going to work if that's what happens in the long run, but even just to get a break right now you're flooded with anxiety Ramona your float it flooded and you need a break from this you need you some Breathing Room the two of you need some breathing room. I need some too but you especially I'm in your corner. About kind of thinking about what you need. The brake is not going to come from a parent right now saying let me come and visit even I wish maybe in my heart of hearts. Do I wish I could come just descended your life. Of course, I can't do that. So how else do we build in kind of quiet internal parent to give the both of you a little bit of breathing room and all of this as you start to sort it all out. I will also talk to dr. Farrow & Hammer home even more than I already that I did already what you're saying to me today because I think it's more of a perspective that she's not thinking of as much. I also would encourage you to go in and don't hold back. Say what you said to me today to her to Ivan what you're feeling about the work and the feeling that maybe you can't get any of this if you feel like you're not being understood or being hard in the work and that's a piece of what she's asked what she's asking you what do you need? What do you need? What do you need? One of the things you're arriving at is I need to feel like people really get what's happening and I don't quite feel like all of your attending what's happening through my eyes. That's a piece of what is that's a piece of what has to happen in the couple's work for you to feel like it has value to you. Say that the next time you're there, but also know that I will have called both of them in the interim and left a little bit more information to make sure they're getting the whole picture of all of this if you continue to feel like Dr. Feroz, not getting it like if you feel like it's biased and you've had a chance to talk about that then it's not working for you. That's important to and what kind of cross that bridge when we come to it, but I think there's a little bit more that can get communicated both from you. And from me before you're at that place. In the meantime, you need a break right now. I would watch movies. I would cook dinner. I would try to keep it light-hearted for a little bit and know that you're getting to keep coming back here and talking about it. He's going to be a very big turning point in his own therapy right now. Is there pee now that this is out there? It opens new doors into places that have never been looked at and if you can get back into the couple's work in a way that feel safe and good for you. I think that could be helpful to bring the things you talked about at home. Bring it here. Try not to have those discussions at home. If you need to see her more often than see her more often. Does that sound like a temporary plan?\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's my spring break. So I'm home. Unless I spend my days. I mean I could go to the library every day, but\n",
            "Doctor: And he's at work.\n",
            "Patient: You know as of this morning has a schedule for the next couple days.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Do you have some time then apart in the evenings together? Any Overture of something that's kind of like a little white flag or peace offering to just get a week of peace. I'm not talking about permanent. I'm going to park it and kowtow to you and talk my needs in other just talking about let's can we take a Hiatus from the intensity of this and try to save some lightheartedness together? No matter where your relationship is headed you both could use the use that right now and I think anything that's kind of waving the Peace Flag for a little bit even if you'd say to him. Let's take a little break. I'm not going to bring anything up. He's got a job right now. You're going to pay the bills this month. He doesn't go to his job one day. That's a different story. Then we have something else to address, but if things can kind of remain kind of percolating along at the moment to take just a little bit of time right now to have some breathing room together, I think Is what you need so that the urgency can calm down some.\n",
            "Patient: Should I even try to call his mom?\n",
            "Doctor: I think it would be helpful to you to try to see what happens. Even if it's just to say I feel like I'm holding a lot. I'm very worried about him. I wanted to see if it would be possible for you to check in with him yourself. See how she responds I would not go into it with High Hopes in your own self protection. You might go into assuming she's going to respond in a way. That's not that productive, but you're putting it out there to try to protect yourself and it's worth a shot. I think that's totally reasonable to do. Okay, I'm out next week on vacation. I haven't said that for a little while, but you may remember me saying that a few weeks ago.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm sorry, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Did Thursday work at all?\n",
            "Patient: I wasn't going to I wasn't going to cuz it kind of like basically I'm going to therapy every day. But yeah, if you're not here the next week, then I should find a way to do it.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. I don't know if I had both times available Thursday morning in the email, but I mentioned 8:20 and 9:10.\n",
            "Patient: That's what you have.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, as of now I do.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Is either one better?\n",
            "Patient: LG 910 I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay and Thursday that works that's when you don't have and I'm out of the office all next week.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I have you checked off my list that I told you.\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm sure I forgot. I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: You're much bigger things on your mind.\n",
            "Patient: Alright. Thank you. Did you stop it?\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Oh cold today.\n",
            "Patient: You can turn that thing on if you want. It's a little chilly. How's it going?\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: Oh man. Well, so yeah a lot going on. Yeah, I definitely like a situational depression thing maybe a little bit. I don't know just been a little bit of a roller coaster last several days even like within the same day like sometimes yeah, I'm having so that's right. Yeah. Yeah Thanksgiving was okay. I mean, you know. I was glad that we did at my cousin's for reasons I said so I didn't hear one political discussion the whole night, you know, but yeah. You know where our families gotten. Just gotten depressing, you know, like there are no women kind of you know Ulysses is a shell of his former self is nothing to talk about really except his stuff. I just yeah, I don't know it was okay. But there was something something about a little I don't want to say pathetic but something was just kind of felt kind of very blah. It was fun to hang out with my little cousins or whatever. But Friday was really nice. I haven't hung out with George. We went to see Peter Wolf. That was nice, you know, it was a fun night via. I don't know just in general. I'm kind of everyday is like a I don't know how it's going on. I'd go any more kind of, you know, just because I'm so Are so many things going on I think yesterday and the day before I really had moments were. I really felt like dark depressed kind of and I realized part of it is because you know, I've just I realize in those moments more than I have before. Thought you know how sucked up these old things and are and me like my mom's voice. So I think now that I'm so much better. And so many ways when I have those moments for some reason I get even it's a really bad momentary. Because I just feel like wow, I must hate myself so much, right? I must have so much. I mean I don't hate myself, but those figures are there. You know what I mean? I aunt like I just get so bad and so like The other night I will. There were also some other like real things that happened but those were really just like I was even down I couldn't even step back to see how will I handle? You know what I mean? Like that's even happening right now. I'm handling things so well, but I have trouble seeing that you know what I mean, and that's depressing. You know what? I'm saying that I don't find Comfort sometimes in that or I don't I don't know if I'm explaining it well, but\n",
            "Doctor: No, it does sound like the way just really describe the last you're really getting into a place where you're making sort of very deep. Very dark feelings about yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Sometimes being able to know that you're unclear feelings or sometimes it can take over.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I can imagine you really will have to find your way. You're out of it.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, yeah, because I think What it is is I think I mean a lot of people experience that I just think that what it is is that if you're an artist in your Ambitions in serious about more than one art form, I mean in other words, I already have so much on my plate that could cause all kinds of melancholy and frustration, you know what I mean? So then when you going to have a couple so then when you couple it with All this old stuff. That's hard plus feeling lonely. Like I'm having a moment where I just feel really lonely like in frustrated. And then it becomes like a vicious cycle, you know, and then I'm going to make you know, that's just not going to happen and not going to find blah blah blah. I don't want to find someone. Assyrian, but how the stock that's going to happen. I want to go to Assyria. But I don't have the money to do that right now. So time is just going by you know what I mean? It just becomes like a the two things that happen though. I did date Sunday night or Saturday night and that I was that I was really looking forward to like this girl was kind of getting butterflies a little bit. Wish that doesn't happen often anymore at all. So we have a great time we go hang out. She has a drink whatever fine. Okay hang out. We had a great time at the end of the night. I walked her kind of halfway home and we make out whatever whatever it the next day or the day after I got an email saying that she doesn't feel comfortable with drinking and driving and for that reason it's just It's just going to work. We can't hang out together. Now it's just like so it got me on so many levels. First of all that sounds like bullshit to me. It just don't say anything. Like if you're just like if you're just not in into it or something. It don't say anything just be a guy about it. Don't I prefer that? Don't give me some weird. I don't like the whole Your Grace you're so awesome. Obviously, I'm not that great in that awesome, you know, but second of all. I was like drinking and what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, it's just I mean that's already obviously sore spot with me. And I was like what so I wrote back to her. I was like, I'm sorry, but I don't who is drinking and driving? I walked you halfway home and then I went what do you mean drinking and driving? and like to two and a half years, but I said on top of all that I told you I was totally fine. If you don't drink like I asked you like I'm totally flexible. We can just have tea. No, she just told me that. You're that uncomfortable. And also, why do we have such a great time? And why do we make out like, what the fuck are you talking about? You know what really got me was a part of the conversation that night. She had this whole thing about when we talk about relationships. And I never even heard this term gaslighting. I don't even know what that was, but she was talking about and she was like, oh my God, that's I didn't know there was a word for that, but that's what happened to me like twice.\n",
            "Doctor: What is that again? I've heard the word, but I kind of.\n",
            "Patient: Gaslight like what Samantha did to me is gas-lighting? where I make you feel like you're crazy and irrational like you're the one being weird, you know, she gives me this whole Thing about that and then she sends me this. I was like dude, that's the ultimate you're doing. The thing that you said, you don't like it doesn't. Don't make any fucking sense, so. I was just like that didn't help. You know, I was like, of course that one girl. I kind of got all you know like that just that was a good because then that put me in a bad, you know, I was like Seether Something There the girls I really want. There's something about me that you don't like me. Like there's something you know, that was fat. That was bad. In the next day this girl that I have been kind of seeing but it's not we haven't talked about any exclusive nothing nothing but one time she was on our second date. She let it slip that she been on another okay stupid date, but I kind of told her I was like, you know, I don't I'm a very don't ask don't tell guy there's no reason like I'm I supposed to be what's the reason to do? to do for me like we're on a date so I don't really want to know but anyway, she had emailed me Sunday and she was she was like she sent me this long email saying, you know is online dating thing is probably it's kind of crazy. I just bought with Y and then she's like, you know, basically I stopped with someone last night and she's like, I just feel really bad. I know that you don't have the sleep don't ask don't tell thing but I just feel like I have to tell you and she was like, I totally understand if you don't want to see me or whatever we had plans that night. That's what it was. She was like, you know, I still really like to see you but she's like it just happened. I totally didn't blah blah blah all the stuff whatever.\n",
            "Doctor: It's odd.\n",
            "Patient: You know what? It's not it's not I wrote back such a great response to her. I wish. I could read it to you. But because it's got me thinking about this whole day and how in a way my response to her and calculated it forced me to crystalize what I think about day and I just told her I was like, you know, I'm not sure how to respond. I mean to us. This is the whole problem with online dating. It's a problem with dating General. I told her I was like we all say we want a certain thing but everything we do. in the ways we try to get those things are totally antithetical to that and I was like, you know, this is why we don't like going I mean, yes, I was I'm on there too, but it's like but it's why but I hate being on there and I'm super super picky about who I actually meet and it's just like we're flipping. It's like shopping. I mean, we all pretend that we're reading profile profile. We're not religious. He's attractive. He's not he's a track if you know what I mean, she's attractive. That's all it is through something. That can't be healthy. There's something that can't be healthy. It just can't. Something doesn't feel healthy. Yes. I know you could walk into a bar and that's what you need. What you do, too, but there's something humane.\n",
            "Doctor: Domane attractive just about the physical.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean what people are doing match.com. Come on. Yeah, of course, there's a profile but you don't really pay attention to that profile unless you already decided someone's really attracted to you.\n",
            "Doctor: to you\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n",
            "Doctor: you mean people?\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: I guess I'm like, are you seeing it as there there's a hierarchy of appearance and\n",
            "Patient: No, no, no.\n",
            "Doctor: only a certain number of people would be found attractive.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, no, no, no. No, I'm just saying for everybody. I'm saying at the end of the day what?\n",
            "Doctor: But it starts.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and what and what I'm saying is that the internet has really boil down to a pretty harsh level. You know what I mean? So just flipping you can literally flip you don't like them flip select. You don't like them to the right. I mean that can't be helping you know what I mean? And it's not about who's the most attractive just in general for all of us, you know. So I was like, you know, but then you need someone in the problem is I know that you're on there right and you know that I'm on there. So what we're supposed to do on the second date, we're supposed to be like, okay, so no more OkCupid this is it like we're going to write no but then so but now you slept with somebody and you're telling me and I was like, how can I see you tonight?\n",
            "Doctor: That's more what I'm saying is all that she told you one thing one that she did it to that. She told you it just feels like self-sabotaging self-sabotage or something. Of course, how are you going to respond to that?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, except I mean but she was totally cool and away. She was wholly like She was like, you know. when I responded she was like I totally understand like she was like she was like If it was me, I'd be pissed. She's like I can't believe you're not more angry or whatever, but I appreciate whatever. I don't know but basically all I said was I think I handled it. I guess this is what I'm saying. Like I handled it really well, but it's so depressing, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: And so why depressing?\n",
            "Patient: It says rainforest. I was like well see you this is why this is why I don't do ya. Let's say she hadn't told me but she still did sleep with another dude. Just like I don't I was like I'm working hard to not be retarded not be more cynical as cynical and jaded not jaded, but just try to trust people more know but Just you know things like that don't help especially coupled with the night before this other chick giving me this weird. It's just all this time. Like what am I doing? It's like you can't win us what I what I was telling I was like, I feel like what dating you can't roll anymore. It's either going to be the love of your life who you marry. I mean, either you're going to get married to this person or I just feel like there's a lot of we're all we're just all so fucked up and I don't know. But I mean that was part of my I mean, you know, but I was proud for not being so angry and somehow it didn't this weird her telling me she slept with this. Other person did I use bad as the night before because it was just honest. And also she was like I want to see you if she's like I messed up and she's like I'm but she was so honest. She she was like I'm really great at the few dates first few days. And then she's like, I'm just not that great. She's like, you know, I just have some things I got to work on. She's like, you know, I haven't been single very often. Like I just don't know how to do this very well and Wobbles and blah blah. I mean it was at least honest, you know, but the night before that just felt Samantha ask that's what surprised me, you know, but yeah coupled together plus all the other bigger broad, you know wanting an Assyrian chick boom has in Delaware what happened with that? That's far away. Do you know what I mean, but she can San Diego, you know, just like I don't know. I signed it all depressing. I just don't know how to.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's part of your experience can be really hard to talk about in a personal way. When I started to say a few minutes ago. I said there are all these dark feelings about yourself that still need to come up and you really need to feel it. Do you really think you got anxious and said that I think other people feel this too and we've talked about that sort of sort of the movement of other people felt this way not just me because I think you do. I think you do start to get anxious like what if it's almost like what if it's true about me.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: If I am really the only one feeling this so therefore, it's me.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And so it's really hard than to ever talk about your personal experience.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know right?\n",
            "Doctor: You so often going to like the generalizations about Society?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I do.\n",
            "Doctor: Where online dating is like this for all the people?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not that like of course that's true on some level.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's a separate thing. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But we never get to know. Rate your experience. Every person has a different experience of online dating, even though there may be General. So societal Trends towards something. It's a unique experience for every person in yours. I think once we even start to touch up on it on it you feel like oh what if I'm the only one\n",
            "Patient: Yeah Yeah Yeahs last night you my called me actually we were texting and I just told her it was like yeah, I'm okay but I just really out of blah blah blah and she called me you know, and I was like I have trouble And yeah, I have trouble and I told her I was like, you know, it's hard like this is hard. I was like I've gotten so much better, but I just yeah I got these old these triggers happening like I'm complaining and weak.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you play?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I just I suddenly really get anxious and I'm just down to like involve my fucking problems and I can't suck it up and be tough.\n",
            "Doctor: Like if you start to talk to her about this problem.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it make you feel like?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, specially the women. Yeah, maybe that's why that happens in here. I never thought about that. I mean not that obviously, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I never thought about that one particular thing that when I talk to women I get anxious even women. I'm not involved with regardless. You cannot be involved with someone but you have a certain image of them. So then I always feel like I don't seem as manly to this woman. And I don't seem as attractive and kind of funeral.\n",
            "Doctor: like if you are\n",
            "Patient: Even if she's a doctor.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think that's what happens because my dude friends I can talk about it a little bit and then it feels more like venting and I just am I and I can just something you know, it's not quite but yeah with women I get flustered. I feel like I'm not articulate and then I'm going to I'm just going on and on it kind of makes it worse.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder if you have any like do where that comes from, but you know like the idea that you're complaining and that's not manly.\n",
            "Patient: my mom\n",
            "Doctor: but specifically where that's not manly\n",
            "Patient: Well, that's I came up with that because I hate it so much when they complaining and I think that's so unattractive that couple. Dark couple that with the making me feel like I'm not attractive register that so then put those together and you know, it just becomes an assumption that complaining is very unattractive. It's stupid.\n",
            "Doctor: wow.\n",
            "Patient: Annoying annoying right because I have no patience for their complaining. So I'll just started assuming that as I am that okay this person doesn't they have their own problems. They don't want to okay. Yes. It's hard. They you know, like another words. But there's a finite very brief window of actually of actual real sympathy or whatever, but then you got to move it along, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's hard for you to imagine what I actually want to hear a lot more than what you actually tell me.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, I think that's basically impossible in my mind. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: well\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, I'll start feeling like oh, you know, well, it's your job, you know, or like I'll think know Claire does really care but it's also her job or you know what I mean? I'll couple the really caring with someone else like while you know, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: or because it's my job that then I can't really care to.\n",
            "Patient: No, no. No I'm saying. I'll say she does really care, but it's also her job.\n",
            "Doctor: Which means?\n",
            "Patient: It just means like if we were just friends that yes, you really do care, but now at some point you'd be like, alright. Well, you know, what am I having for dinner or even worse? I mean the dog is place my mind goes. You're like, you know, thank God my boyfriend's not like this. You know what? I mean? Yeah, I think it's so funny when you say I'm in. In my mind, it's almost it's become like a bit of a game like wow then. When Clara says we're all the fucking psychologist is saying that's some hardcore shit.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, like it's just foreign to me to hear that. That's what's going on. And that you think that was my experience. You know, that's it's really\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I'm not saying that it's what you're thinking.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: here, I don't go quiet there, you know, but If this wasn't here, oh, yeah. Yeah if I was going on and on like this immediately, yeah, my mind will go like I'm sure her husband is yeah, there's probably something bad about him. He just tougher than me use, you know what I mean? Like all just it's bad. That's a bad place to go.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and I think what I'm saying you have about this is that it's very particular image from your childhood from your mother.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And your father like his though. That's the that's the factual answer. Everybody thinks about what is it? What it is to be a man?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: raven, like there's no room for\n",
            "Patient: Police officer to I'm sorry, go ahead.\n",
            "Doctor: Go ahead. Yes.\n",
            "Patient: It's also the opposite right? I mean, I'm actually just making it this connection now, but I can't believe I didn't think of it before but it's also the inverse. Why can't I get that's one reason that's one side, but then I have trouble also listen to girlfriend still make it right. Because then I start projecting little bit like she's getting a little complaining out, you know. and that's not fair either but\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I do that because I think I'm I immediately get like us a good relationship going to be a lot of like talking to me for an hour everyday about our fucking job and has a bitch the girl who sits next to her as such a bad as you know what I mean. So I have a low tolerance like I don't know. I think it's because I can't sometimes I forget there's difference between just whining.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: And just talking about real problems not just some asshole at work like going on and on about that, but you know what we're talking about here emotional like real kind of course things not just someone cut you off on the road and you're going on and on about how pissed off you are, you know?\n",
            "Doctor: That's exactly what I was going to say is that I don't think your experience with your mother and your father by the way because you've got either stoic because you've got either stoic and tough or constantly complaining.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Without it going anywhere ever.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: as you two examples of what like these are the choices about how to be\n",
            "Patient: Plus in the Assyrian Community, that's\n",
            "Doctor: How it divides up?\n",
            "Patient: I hate to say yeah, I'm not trying to generalize but you know the women tend to be kind of fucking shrill and chatterboxes and them intend to be so occur. funny guy kind of type guys\n",
            "Doctor: So there's not room for actual like that ideas of having feelings or concerns or problems.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: a dark dark stuff\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That you're sharing that that you're sharing that is not complaining. Like there's a falls into complaining sure if somebody like chronically complaining without anything moving and it was feeling when you fell I think it was your mother like you got shut out. That's one thing to me. It feels more like when I get to hear like a wisp of what actually what actually is personal to you. It feels more like just getting to know you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It doesn't feel like complaining.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It feels like oh that's his experience rather than societies experience. I know what societies experiences I don't need to hear any more of that.\n",
            "Patient: But yeah, it's depressing.\n",
            "Doctor: Where do you just go?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I was just thinking like wow that just adds. I mean, I see it so clearly now like see that I'm also not good at listening and you know, I'll listen but then like shut inside I'll be kind of shut down after a certain point. I'm like, all right. Yes again wrap it up. You know, that's not good either, you know, so that I'm so I'm at\n",
            "Doctor: You know like another to it if you can follow this one of the reasons, I think you shut down when someone's talking is that for one it could be so it could simply be treating all the stuff in your mother. But in particular if what happens with your mother is her complaining her venting her smothering but the cost of seeing you at all like you disappeared then when you're with somebody who is venting complaining whatever bitching about a day. I think that will Child part but just once to actually be seen and validated an existing that relationship can really really can feel really smothered by this other person taking up a lot of space, but had you an experience where you\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's that's what I'm saying because I'm forgetting the part about whoever that person is and yes, they are venting but this is totally different. They're seeing me.\n",
            "Doctor: some of them probably do but some of them they are probably some that don't to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well the ones I'm thinking of specifically they saw me.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, you know even Tara, you know, yeah, she was kind of fucked up. But I mean she you know, she love me. I mean she you know, that was you know, she did. It was you know again kind of a Meredith thing. Like maybe I was going to work out long like maybe it wasn't going to work out long-term. But I mean she you know\n",
            "Doctor: You felt at home there.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, absolutely God. Yeah. Yeah, I mean most of the time. I kind of did to be honest with you. I mean, there's been very few where I didn't feel like I was you know.\n",
            "Doctor: The capacity to really hear another's and just be there with them develops over that having been done for oneself, you know to not feel so squash by another person.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Or if you trust him, you know the amount of listening right now, they'll listen to me tomorrow.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: They're here for me, too.\n",
            "Patient: Got it makes me sick.\n",
            "Doctor: How so? What?\n",
            "Patient: It's just like I've already been feeling kind of headache you the last two days. So it's just like yeah because it's just overwhelming, you know, it's like and this is the other thing when I have these feelings lately. I'm like, wow, it's not going to change tomorrow. So it's hard to not let Make it worse, you know what I mean? That's also that also fat. Almost makes it worse that I don't like time is just March along and I'm so trying to work the shit out. I know I've gotten so much better. I have to remind myself of that because it's just frustrating. and then With all the snow yesterday. I started recording an EP and it's like last night. I was thinking what see this I can't take it. Like I just wrote this song over the weekend. Okay, I don't have lyrics yet. I went to the coffee shop yesterday. I was some of the best lyrics I've I've ever written I think. In Like A 1 hour. Shut up to the space recorder rap version. That sounds fucking amazing. These guys had never heard the song before and yet I can't you know what I mean? And you know all this is happening. You know what I'm saying? Like that's just I'm losing patience with my so you know and That I don't know how to get out of that. It's become such a that to me feels like a broken record.\n",
            "Doctor: Let's say about that.\n",
            "Patient: Just like, you know just not being able to talk and relax a little bit. Like wow, what a great productive. You know what I mean? I can't like I'm worked up. I'm depressed. I'm fucking anxious. You know what I mean? Like that is just not it's not working for me anymore. This is why things aren't getting done properly. You know what? I mean? Because I work on a song but somehow I'm still feeling all fucked up and not comfortable and content. I'm staying with anything. You know if I start riding is good, but if it's anything like pulling teeth, I can't just enjoy the process and I just I don't know. I don't know how to fix that anymore. I just don't know what to do. I can't stop trying to accomplish all these things. You know, I don't know how to just fucking relax, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: What you're feeling right now is anxious. Is that what what's the feeling?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's anxious and depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: You're down on yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, that's what it is mostly.\n",
            "Doctor: I think at heart that's what you're saying.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that your lonely sometimes?\n",
            "Patient: Identifix sure of myself to send you this girl that the one who said she slept who said she slept with whatever and even that right it was It's a little thing but it's not little too big thing. One of the pictures. I took I hated the picture of myself so much for my ankle. I started like I started focusing on my nose skin. I was like, oh my God, my nose looks awful looks awful. What the fuc? How can I have a nose job? How can I have a nose job and it's it looks like I mean I I like I literally wanted to like smash my face with a hammer. And so I was so, you know, even though at the same time I was like What the fuck am I thinking like why you know what? I mean? Like, I mean, I was surprised at my own reaction, but I couldn't stop myself from having that reaction and that's tiring and depressing and frustrating. It gives you headaches, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Smashing your face with a hammer.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I just I hated I just was like I felt so ugly and fucking disgusting. But meanwhile, I'm like I'm like in my mind like thinking of concrete all these girls. I've been dating and how and I was like, all right, even the one who told me not to drink it the I was like well like she's told me I mean, I don't think that means some that means something was attractive. I mean she wasn't drunk at all. So I don't and so in other words, I was trying to get my selfie stupid very immature hats.\n",
            "Doctor: again, the proof\n",
            "Patient: Approved. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: like it can't be true, right?\n",
            "Patient: Right, right.\n",
            "Doctor: What I tell myself.\n",
            "Patient: but then again that's almost more depressing because then I was like because now I'm in a place where I'm like, yeah, but that that's how depressing ass has that stuff doesn't matter and he's moments. I can go through all the list of all the beautiful women that have thought. I'm handsome or whatever the facts but\n",
            "Doctor: And they have been treated the same way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and what's up?\n",
            "Doctor: They haven't treated the same way.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's really cool. Maybe just like being with you and you were talking about.\n",
            "Patient: What do you do? Yeah. Yeah, it's great.\n",
            "Doctor: you say that Brian but\n",
            "Patient: I know know I know but\n",
            "Doctor: I feel like it's been hard for you to be specific about what you experienced.\n",
            "Patient: I know I know.\n",
            "Doctor: When you hate what even dark what even dark feelings even mean, I mean, you know, lots of people have dark feelings, but it would help if you show me what it means and what you associate to it bringing things up memories.\n",
            "Patient: know that I get all that it's just like I said what unfortunately that could also make it more depressing because you're like wow, and I'm just Like I'm still working on this shit and it's you know. Like its just oh my God, you know what I'm saying? like I just feel like This is a just yeah, it just makes me feel like Yep. This this is it I could be working on this probably maybe for years and years. And in the meantime is opportunities to connect with a woman blah blah mean like that. It's like I hope I'm trying to climb out of should I keep thinking I'm almost out of it, but I just\n",
            "Doctor: It's been my experience that when you have hit upon some of the real hard feelings and experiences. You see the four second you stay with them for a minute. And then you package them up nicely neatly into some play table form and put them back on the shelf and they remain there. They actually they never actually get to participate stay there and like really look at them, you know like that and analogy of being in the storm and then the stormy waters then you called calm down and then you actually get To beneath the surface and what's going to be down there and what happens if you're just swimming around in whatever it is you find I think that's a part of what it feels like you keep finding it and there still more is that of course this because it got packaged up so quickly and put away because it was so scary. I say, it's cool. And you say well gray. I don't want want to be somebody swimming around in the Darkness.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But to be able to do that is new. That's a new capacity.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know I get that. I mean that's what I'm saying. I recognize that that's why I feel more depressed and kind of fucked up is because I'm staying with these feelings like at home, you know. Yeah, I watch Netflix or whatever but I don't try to I don't try to put these things out of my mind anymore whatever and I see them for what they are. And I know that it's healthier and all that but it's like right now like, you know, I'm like totally, you know, like head achy all over here and like I'm not good over here. You know what I mean? Like, I'm getting that tighten saying you get with the Panic or anxiety where you almost feel like you're outside of yourself a little bit. It's like unnerving, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a lot of feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. You know what? I was thinking I had another idea for a book. And I wonder if this is the one that needs to be written in a way like all these things are leading to I was just thinking you know what maybe I need to write a really really like Stark naked honest brutal maglish memorize whatever of all my experiences with women, you know what I mean?

Every time I touch something that someone else may have touched such as door knob light switch for a faucet handle. I usually use a paper towel to open things. So I don't have to touch anything directly if I touch something and I don't wash three times. Then I am afraid that I will get get germs that could cause me to get sick. I have fears that I forget to lock the door turn off the lights. So I will go and turn the Lock 3 times in the need to wash my hands three times. I find this happening so much that I am late for my job in the morning on my way to work. I have had to turn around and drive home to see if I remembered to turn off the coffee pot.

All the time that I had for the blacked out this weekend for for caring for tutoring and also preparing researching for this talk during the week pretty much most of it but like staring blankly at it. So I've been doing a lot of that. I feel like I have some creep disease but like it doesn't look like it and that's something like every 5 or 10 minutes after I started decide not to kill myself that takes a lot of work.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I become mad and I feel like I'm less concerned about how other people are going to feel about the things that say than I usually am which in itself is probably a good thing, but nobody seems to mind.\n",

            "Patient: Yeah, it's not yeah. I don't know. I'm I'm afraid of dying, but I think I'm more afraid of just continuing to be like this. You know just started frantically racing through my options. And if I do this, then this will happen and if I do this, then this will happen then these are the things that might happen visible things that probably won't happen. Like I just can't I can't come up with one where that doesn't keep. You know that the best I can come up with is things get better for a while, which at this point is not so bad. I have lots of I feel like I feel like the. Where I start thinking maybe this will just be over like maybe I won't have to feel this way and then it comes back. I feel like that is really bad that it's the worst and so\n",
            "Doctor: surepoint the rug out\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Somehow it still seems very important because we have to learn now that this is what my wife is occurring now. I feel like the little things that might.\n",
            "Doctor: you sounded worse me actually the last week.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: At first when you said about feelings for your less dependent like putting stuff out there. I wasn't sure. In a way good thing coming from it.\n",
            "Patient: I don't care.\n",
            "Doctor: We talked about last time it doesn't seem that way as we talked more. It seems like you don't care in the way that even when you're feeling pretty bad. You generally still do.\n",
            "Patient: It's really bad. I mean it gets worse than this but not that much worse.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I haven't forgot. I'm just I'm trying to remember the last time it was like this. It's been awhile. On one hand it's mostly in. automation of self-hatred and fighting amongst yourself\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, even like the fault isn't as much a thing anymore. Like I don't end up hurting myself. yeah, I don't know I Haven't been thinking about hating myself as much and sometimes it's blank. It's still there somewhere, but I don't have to deal with it all the time. It took me to the whole day to sort of tell myself. Like, you know, Tanya really have to tell somebody at church at church about this like this is your job. Tell them to do their job. And so I like at the end of the was I was leaving told one of the priests that I'm doing really badly and ask her to pray for me and she said she would she said like you're awesome at the end that sort of ended me not like you're awesome. So you shouldn't be feeling bad but more like you should remember that. You're awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, which I guess which I guess you're a complete disaster.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I sort of a little bit.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess my point being my box over there.\n",
            "Patient: I'm a sick man. It's like the tissue box that will not die.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess that my point was that that's how I imagined. It felt. That's part of what it Feel so awful. Is that so far?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, and my thought was that's completely the size of me, but it's just weird thing. Like I know why she would think that I'm awesome. Like I can see how I look to other people, you know, at least two other people who think I'm awesome. I can see that but like it doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: So the main thing is that you're feeling quite a bit miserable in a tremendous amount of emotional pain.\n",
            "Patient: I guess so. I mean if you poke at it like I'm miserable because I feel like I'm a terrible person and part of it comes around but Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: my kind of it sounds like that part of the story isn't feeling at Central as other times it you know, and it sounds like also this doesn't have the kind of beat yourself up quality of feeling low can has for you it's more like whenever like I get a sense that you're indulging yourself a lot or blaming to yourself or feeling. Inadequate sometimes you're just feeling awful.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Anyway, when I like my when I like involve myself or fend for myself is at least a presumption that things could be different, but I don't feel like that's a possibility. It's like the only computer game. I remember ever playing we never had a computer games when I was little we just didn't have any consoles and never got any other. So it was like a brief. Of time where golden I was like the game. It was a long time ago, but there was a time and so like a little bit after it came out. I was over like a like a family friend's house and they're a little like kids downstairs playing a game. And so I picked it up and play it and just like could not like I couldn't get the character who walked around out of the corner. Like I was just in a corner the entire game, but it was like well Was it for video games like not much fun when you can't get out of the corner. So that's what I feel like.\n",
            "Doctor: my sensation to not being able to get out of Corner in a video game is that it's kind of disorienting among other things like you can't they move and you can't figure out where you're looking and\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and in that game everything's dark the entire time. I'm like It feels like you and James and doctor is like people who are trying to help me. It feels like with the best of intentions You're All I've been afraid to continue down this incredibly painful and destructive path. That's disorienting.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and you're welcome. Have imagined in some ways. It's actually worse in that not only are we inviting you but especially James and someway is making you feel obligated. I think that's especially. I complete like I completely crave. Tuna. I'm not saying you're saying.\n",
            "Patient: I know.\n",
            "Doctor: No, I think about it. Yeah, you're right. But there's a language that people are referring to you. Maybe think. I don't understand what you mean by that but there are ways in the short-term, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. but I hear you.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Are you surprised?\n",
            "Patient: Am I surprised?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Not really. Yeah, I do.\n",
            "Doctor: And why keep going in spite of how excruciating it is?\n",
            "Patient: I don't feel good about that.\n",
            "Doctor: I imagine that feels like a lot of things have been a failure for you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's all beyond me.\n",
            "Patient: I don't really like the alternative either.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you think? There are no good options.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not really been bearable. the only thing in particular that I can\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I have you been thinking about of doing it to yourself.\n",
            "Patient: mostly things like the highest likelihood of success combined with what it's most likely I'd actually do. Yeah, what districts are hard but not that hard to hard if I want them to be hard. This tutoring sessions going to be more. I thought about just taking the car somewhere. I think maybe I just won't go to tutoring.\n",
            "Doctor: When's it at?\n",
            "Patient: 2:30\n",
            "Doctor: Is James at home or out somewhere?\n",
            "Patient: he's at home.\n",
            "Doctor: What did he say when you\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: did you watch anything yesterday?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: No, are you sure of that?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I wasn't so sure of making it through the weekend.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I know I continue to put the decision about this in your hands, but I assume and I want to make sure I'm correct that you really don't want to go to the hospital.\n",
            "Patient: Part of me dies because it's hard to have to keep the fight and not kill myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Part of me. Most of me doesn't because it's a pain in the ass and it doesn't seem like I feel like I got to the same place that I started out in. I forgot the option. But I continue to think that it would be worse to try and fail than not to try and fail if that.\n",
            "Doctor: But something that's not a whole lot.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't want to think about it.\n",
            "Doctor: You're pretty sure you'll cancel the tutoring session.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, if it were like two hours later, that's so long then.\n",
            "Doctor: How long is it?\n",
            "Patient: It's like 3 hours.\n",
            "Doctor: around 2\n",
            "Patient: yeah 3\n",
            "Doctor: 3 yeah.\n",
            "Patient: but they be either or like 3 hours. I would feel like there was a yeah, sometimes I can rally.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: But I think maybe I need to not ask myself to Rally right now.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's why because particularly after 3 hours of holding it together you could\n",
            "Patient: I hadn't thought about that. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: in that case and then what like\n",
            "Patient: I don't know, you know, I can't decide whether it be better to go to work tomorrow or not to go to work tomorrow. Seems like a long way off though.\n",
            "Doctor: Now, let's wait on that one. I mean to use it.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I could take a nap right now. Sorry. I'm just like I don't even want to say it like okay Chad, so I'll tackle the afternoon. I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: You know, I'm not joining that you're feeling a bunch of pressure for me to make a plan not to kill yourself in to stay alive. And that feels pretty awful.\n",
            "Patient: That's not quite it but I don't know how to I don't know how I can explain it.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: I had a I don't know what it's like it doesn't feel like you're trying to put pressure on me or like it doesn't feel like you're asking this of me. It's more like I don't know who it is. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: We're getting a minute where it's coming from. Is that the pressure that you're feeling?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Right now like you have a dial on your back just the pressure that I'm not actively to kill myself this afternoon. Yeah, I know I can make it through the next few hours, but I don't know if I want to will know. I know I don't want to I don't know whether I'm willing to.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. If you do it won't be for you.\n",
            "Patient: probably\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm up to my I mean, I'm perfectly aware that at the end of the day I can keep you from killing yourself. You know what you know that.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I also know that you don't often want to with the intensity or with as much as yourself or something like that. I also know that you might feel better in a few hours or not this bad.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm counting on it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm actually sort of inclined to think that I mean, I don't need to be at Mystic.\n",
            "Patient: No, that's okay. Yeah, that's how it goes. I feel better for a while and then I feel worse for a while.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. I mean, I guess one that I have is you know, if you're going to go home most likely will take a nap and then touch base a little after 6 or something.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: When you get home from the hospital.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Which I could probably be anytime, you know. Why doesn't James have a hand in it?\n",
            "Patient: He knows what's going on. He we talked about it this morning and he acted sort of trying to keep it in scaring him too much for would have doubted on him too much. So we talked about it this morning, but on the way home, he asked me whether you and I had talked about hospitalization or something. Yeah, I think he knows Destin option now.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it didn't feel like to me. It didn't feel to me like we were all that close to death until see I mean, I knew that death you told me but\n",
            "Patient: I know.\n",
            "Doctor: he's absolutely right, of course that like He always seems like current time or Jag but there's no guarantee about the next one will come.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry, I'm taking a little time to figure this out.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I'll be I could probably go home to stare at the wall. So, you know, I can do that here.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you have a\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't know. I feel like it's equally impossible. I equally possible that, you know, I could go home and watch some TV and joke around with James and have a nice night and then I could go home and said that I'm done. I can't tell and yeah clearly I usually end up the former but\n",
            "Doctor: Actually, the truth is the truth is always ended up the former.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I usually ended always.\n",
            "Doctor: so far\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well know sometimes I'm miserable and don't go.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, that's true. But as long as you're around.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You know, I don't like it. I think James should come and you guys should go to the ER and I think it's possible by the time I see you you're feeling better enough or you think you're feeling a little better. If you're waiting there for three or four hours you start to feel better. Call me and you can come back here and we can talk.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You know this evening either of them you can come by and we can go from there. I'm happy to do that. But There's something about that. kind of angry abandoned that's got me concerned in a way that I think I was at times last year. my worry about that is I mean my concerns might a psychological point of view is that this will convey to you. There's something about that kind of anger hostility being with James that You know is always going to be dangerous. So I'm somewhat concerned about that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I know that's not what you mean.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, right. See what happens when you're unconscious. Yeah, I think that'll that probably a good plan is love Jaymes come by you guys go to the ER you'll probably have to wait a while there. Anyway, if you start to feel better, you know, call me and you can come in a little later and we'll talk some more and go from there. And if you don't feel better stay there, I guess the first question is does it seem in my putting you in a reasonable position? I don't want to put you in a position where you're having to make a decision is overwhelming. Do you sitting waiting in the ER and if that's the case?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. No, I mean if it starts to feel absurd to be there, then I'll come home. I guess my question is will they just let me leave?\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know I would have assumed so but I don't know they can I'm sure they can get me on the phone or you guys likely can call me on your cell phone or something and I can come and get you and we can sort of and we can sort it out that way.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thanks. No, I can just call.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, let's see. So how do you want to do this? You want to just call James now from here you want to do you want me to hear while you call them? Call him?\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I assumed that was your lunch.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, that's alright. Don't worry. I don't really.\n",
            "Patient: Hey, hey, it's Tanya. Hey, are you there James? Yeah, okay. Sorry. I'm still at therapy. Chad wants me to go to ER. So can you come over? Okay. Thanks. Thanks.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know how long he'll be?\n",
            "Patient: Probably 10 minutes.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, will he want to talk with me? I mean how I guess what I was\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I would think you would want to talk to you briefly.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Alright, that's fine.\n",
            "Patient: So what do I do now? Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I'll be 10 minutes. I'm going to eat some bread. Do you want anything?\n",
            "Patient: No, thanks.\n",
            "Doctor: You sure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: I don't how but I have to get in touch with the person. I'm supposed to be tutoring. It's like one of those websites so I don't.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you like have the contact information?\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't I do somewhere, but it's not like my phone.\n",
            "Doctor: You got it on my iPad.\n",
            "Patient: I could actually okay. Yeah.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, come on in.\n",
            "Patient: Hi.\n",
            "Doctor: How are you doing?\n",
            "Patient: Good fun day at work.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Usually the way I work with people is I like you for you to start with whatever's on your mind and then we can kind of take it from there.\n",
            "Patient: What's on my mind? Sorry just like because I on Thursdays. I'm at work. So I just haven't. Stop thinking about work task because it's only like two blocks away from here. So just from one place to another.\n",
            "Doctor: short transition\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm only there two days a week, but it could be a full-time job. So there's a lot to get done in a small amount of time that I am there. But I guess so we're back in Chicago at my parents house this weekend. And I finally talked to my dad and my brother a little bit about what their experience with their anxiety are and they both have been seeing people for years now, but nobody ever thought to tell me that I should do the same. So yeah, I always thought that I had it worse than everybody else in the family, but it doesn't seem to be the case. My dad was telling me that he really struggles with that and my grandmother apparently really struggled with depression my dad and most of his siblings. He was the youngest of five and three or four of them all also had a pretty bad anxiety and get panic attacks. I didn't know that my brother was seeing Somebody either but they were both really supportive. So that was nice. Is coming in a way to know that I didn't somehow get like the worst of it but then knowing that it's so bad for everyone. You know, it's like oh man. Like I guess this is just part of like in my jeans. It's just part of my life. So it's also kind of weird to think that okay. Maybe I'm not going to ever get rid of it, you know. because my dad was saying he tries his best, but they're definitely periods of time when he really I mean he gets It was like he was saying that he was feeding feeling like that's the same thing. I feel dad. He was saying that he was always just thinks the worst is going to happen. I was like, that's what I think all the time. You know with Amelia doesn't text me back. I'm never going to see her again, you know something horrible happened to her. So it's comforting actually I think more so then the not knowing that you know, they also deal with this.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're not alone somehow.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I didn't somehow just end up this way that nobody else did.\n",
            "Doctor: That seems like quite new information.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I never knew I never really knew that they ya know it's definitely really new information for me.\n",
            "Doctor: Because you were saying last week, you don't think your dad has ever gotten treatment because that's kind of who he is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well, it's that's what he projects. I know it's funny. I wouldn't to Wesley Tuesday to hear talk and some of my classmates and professors and I'm not on campus this semester. Obviously the first thing that every one notices that I've lost like 15 pounds because I've been sick. So I was talking to one of my advisors about work and everything and kind of joking around about my ulcer and she says You're really the last person I would ever think I would get an ulcer. You just seem so calm and laid-back all the time. All I could do was laugh because that's the opposite. How I feel about people that don't like really know me not that she doesn't know me well, but where we have a professional relationship, maybe I come off the same way. My dad does. I don't know because I always thought my dad ugly as a laid-back one compared to my mom. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: People confuse not expressing one's the stress is laid back. Some people are just very expressive that doesn't necessarily mean that other people are anxious.\n",
            "Patient: Well, and I think for me like in a professional setting like I don't get all of that worked, you know, and I've done mix and at work, I'm very efficient and things don't really like writing papers or having these professional and academic test doesn't really I mean, I'll be like, oh, I've got to get this one, but I get it done and I do things well, and I think that in those settings people won't necessarily think that I'm up type or stressed out.\n",
            "Doctor: I would think also that you might function better and structured environment.\n",
            "Patient: totally\n",
            "Doctor: That wouldn't be where your anxiety would show itself.\n",
            "Patient: when I'm busy or it's like less time for me to think about other things in about my anxiety, like for example yesterday. I was at my other job where I have a lot of it's just not a structure and I don't feel as productive. I'm not sure why that is it's just maybe because I still I don't know maybe it's just it's two different working environment. I feel like I have a lot of time where I'm just kind of sitting around not necessarily like go go go like the way that I am at work. So I feel a lot more anxious yesterday. Where about where Amelia was and what she was doing compared to today. We touch base maybe one or two times via text message, but that was it and it didn't really bother me at all because I was just busy and I knew that I had x y and z Things I needed to get done before I got out of the office. So I do like it better when I have a structured environment with lots of things going on for me to focus on that. Aren't my anxiety. I think that's why I don't really like being by myself all that much.\n",
            "Doctor: That's when you find yourself. Where in the most\n",
            "Patient: Like when I'm at home waiting for a milli or something like that, you know when I first get home.\n",
            "Doctor: kind of like you were a when you're alone with your own thoughts.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's very rare that I have an afternoon in the apartment by myself that I'm excited. Most people would be excited to lay on the couch and do nothing and have nobody there to know that they're being lazy, you know, I don't really I used to have that I used to get excited when I can have the afternoon to myself but I don't really have that anymore. I tried to fill my time with other things on Wednesdays for Amelia is at school until 9 at night. So one day once he's like my night to try to go see some friends or something like that and keep myself at work later do something right after work, so I'm not just home by myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Are there other things that you learn from your dad and your brother?\n",
            "Patient: I didn't ask if he had ever. I don't know. I mean, I would assume that we you would have told me if you ever tried taking medications because we are talking about how he manages the symptoms. He says that is why he works out. Fanatic lie all the time to try to keep himself calm, but it doesn't necessarily help my brother and I only talked briefly as we were walking from dinner to another point, so we didn't really get into too much stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: You were talking last week around about your body and worrying about having a physical problem after the doctor's office was closing. Are you less focused on it today or this week or not? Really?\n",
            "Patient: I've been I'm finally feeling better like today and yesterday I'm eating a little bit more now and I feel like either I'm going to get used to the medication or I wasn't really having side effects at all, or maybe a mentally getting used to the fact that I have to take medication. I'm still kind of like I just want to know want this to be over you now and the whole reason that I have a ulcer in the first place is because I was taking too much Aleve for my sensitive stomach combined with my stress. But the reason I was taking so much relieved was because I got really painful periods and so my cycle came a week early this morning, but I can't take anything. So I'm just not because I'm focused on that right now. I'm focused like just trying to get through having really bad cramps and not being able to take any painkillers for it that maybe I'm not so I'm like It's weird, but it's kind of nice to be having a health situation that I'm familiar with. I'm okay. I'm like, okay, these cramps are. You know what? They are. I'm not worried that I'm having ovarian cancer because I'm having cramps right now, you know, like this has happened to me my entire life. It sucks that I can't take anything for it because I'm uncomfortable but it's distracting me from the ulcer stuff and from the possible side effects of ulcer medication, so I don't feel all that stress about it at the moment. Cuz I'm distracted I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: It's something that's familiar to.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, because this you know, it's not like something new and maybe I'm not stressed because I'm not taking any medications to take Tylenol. So maybe I'm stressed about it. I'm allowed to take Tylenol, but I don't want to take it.\n",
            "Doctor: because\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It makes me nervous and I think that I'd rather. Because the reason I was on it so much Aleve is like two Advil doesn't mean anything do anything for me. So in my head I'm like, well Town knows not going to do anything. So while I was taking it and having something else happen.\n",
            "Doctor: like what?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know like I'm not supposed to I know it's not a blood thinner which is why I can't take it because I just had the buy Topsy the last week. So I'm not supposed to take Aleve or Motrin or any blood thinner. I was just convinced it will make me sick because that's all the medication has done to me for the last you know what I mean, but I mean, but we've made me sick and send the medication they gave me first for my stomach made me sick and the medication they gave me to do endoscopy made me sick and it's like I just want to like I'm ready to go on a yoga retreat and drink herbs or something and get acupuncture and not deal with anymore Pharmaceuticals at this point.\n",
            "Doctor: Herbs can make you sick.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not that I want to give you something else to be anxious about.\n",
            "Patient: No bad. I just I'm like, I don't know. I'm already taking one medication. So what's going to happen if I take another I don't like all that chemicals in my body. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it feel like it's contaminating you somehow?\n",
            "Patient: It gives me that same feelings when like everytime. I swallow pill I get that feeling right there as this the day that I didn't either too much cocaine or lace cocaine or laced cocaine and it gives me that rush in my chest. It's like a panic attack. So maybe that day I didn't do something lice and I didn't overdose at all. Maybe I had a panic attack while I was high on cocaine totally possible because I can't really separate the two but it's that same feeling that I get when and it happened a couple nights ago to it's been hard for me to start eating again because for a month every time I ate I got really sick because I have no sir. So it's been difficult for me to start eating again and Monday night. I sat down for dinner and it was the first time I was going to eat some veggies and some actual food. That wasn't white tasteless. I start eating am I eat a little bit quickly because I was hungry now my appetite back which is good and no son. I felt that you know, it was like I had a panic attack after taking a couple bites of food And I felt that Rush up in my it's like that warm feeling like my chest gets really hot. Almost like there is hot liquid shooting up from there. I thought I was going to vomit at first. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Was happening that bad coke me an experiment. Was that the first time you had a panic attack?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think so if that was a panic attack then I'm pretty sure that was the first time.\n",
            "Doctor: It's unclear if it was chemical induced or not.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I think that's why but maybe you know, I think that's where a lot like a lot. I'm not surprised that it's kind of feeling I get one like when I get a shot also, like I really hate vaccines and I had to get so many of them to go to Egypt just to apply to the Red Cross you had to get a school get the whole works, you know. Like I need to get my flu shot next week because of where I work and I'm really dreading it because anytime anything for an entered my body chemically, I don't like it and it gives me that same feeling.\n",
            "Doctor: But this wasn't true for you before that experience.\n",
            "Patient: there was I remember having a panic attack after I got one of my vaccines. Where was I going though? I don't remember I was still in college and my car so it was after this it was after that experience. Yeah, so I think that was the first time.\n",
            "Doctor: You told me a little bit about what happened that day, but can you go into a little bit more detail about it?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, or that actually might have been the second time depending on if now in retrospect. I'll tell you about the day in a second. In retrospect I had a allergic reaction. So when I was 19 and I was having my first round of GI issues they wanted to do an upper GI Series so I like swallowed the chalky stuff. Then they were going to give me this IV to make it light up in the CT scan machine or something so they could watch as it goes down when they started the IV. Everyone said I had an allergic reaction but I stopped breathing and then got some hives and so they said I had allergic reaction but in retrospect this was still the same kind of like my chest got really hot. Although I think it might have been I mean, I'm sure I had allergic reaction if there's position saying you're having an allergic reaction, but I don't know maybe Maybe the cocaine thing was the second time. I'm not sure. Anyway, so that day my friend Marie was visiting. I had just gotten back from my trip Madagascar. It was maybe a month-and-a-half after going to volunteer in Madagascar which would wear my stomach problems kind of just I like started eating again and it's kind of like a combination weather eating issue issue I had once because there was no real option. Like I was just going to eat the food that was there because I couldn't really be picky but I wasn't getting sick. So I was like healthy again. I was still getting exercise. So I just got back maybe a month or month-and-a-half of my good friends who I had a huge crush on was volunteering with me. This was in Chicago visiting she was living in Montana. So she came out to Chicago to visit and there was a bunch of other people that I'd volunteered with us who lives and kind of like the Chicago metro area. So we're all planning on getting together that night from our conversations getting to know each other while we were in Madagascar. I knew that Alex lights. 2 we used to call it like to party or whatever and they did cocaine, so I thought this would be fun if we all get together and I'll get us a gram Coke to split and we can go out in Chicago. Have a good time. The plan was that we were going to first before we went out in that are friends Maria and I were going to meet my mom. My mom works in the city. So we are going to meet my home at our office and she was going to take us to the Red Cross information session that was being held in Chicago. The plan was not to do the cocaine before we went to meet my mom obviously, but I remember there was like some travel we didn't think you were going to get in the guy that I was supposed to get with from was not going to be able to come true. So we we were going to just not get it. And then last minute called me that he had it and we could pick it up. So it was like we were excited that we could got it because we didn't think we were going to and so we decided we would just do a little before going into the city. It makes me kind of nauseous even thinking about how we then like and we just put out these like I mean they were really big it was like more than I usually would do so early in the day. And before I was about to be driving from Greenwich to into the city if you'd like sick to my stomach that I did it. But I would think it was okay to do that. I thought it was okay to be snorting cocaine in the first place and I thought it was okay to drive myself and my good friend to meet my mom and go to the Red Cross information session. Like I don't even know what I mean. God and God forbid something were to happen. And then I'm having this panic attack. So we did some and it didn't feel right if burned in the cocaine is not supposed to burn it numbs you you know And so for some reason I did all three lines and then was like, oh and Friends tried it and said don't do it. Like oh God you already did them. There's something not right with that. I don't know what it's it is but like I'm not doing anymore. Yeah, I mean it might have been a panic attack but remembering how I felt later. I was really sick from this. So we started driving and I was like blacking out as we were driving. I felt like I had this fever that like, I was just on this one. I don't think maybe it was part. well, if you know\n",
            "Doctor: You sort of panicked having that experience.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I didn't tell Marie what was going on. Somehow got us both into the city. I haven't really thought about this much in detail in a while. And I really can't believe this happened and that I'm fine. But I remember thinking in the car on the way down because my mom is going to meet us at the parking garage and I could remember thinking on the way down. I need to tell my mom. Either I either needed to pull over right now and call my mom. I need to tell her as soon as I get out of the car that she needs to take me to the emergency room because I snort something that it shouldn't have and I was like totally sick enough. that was okay for me to have my parents were strict growing up and I was at the point where I was like, I need to tell my mom she needs to take me to the hospital before because I think I'm dying. I remember getting out of the car and my mom took one look at me and said it was like what's wrong and I was like I just don't feel that well but she would never think that oh my daughter is on drugs she would think I have the flu you know what I mean like she would never think I was just like I don't feel well because I decided I think by the time we were there I was feeling a little bit and had passed a little bit so I think I decided that I was going to try just try like I felt really sick and I wanted to go through up somewhere so we went to the building where Red Cross thing was being held and it's a federal building so we had to go through security at this gram of coke look in my purse that I just stopped on the security belt nothing happened but I was just not with it at all I didn't even remember nothing about the channel I was in the bathroom trying to puke the entire time and I just kept looking at myself in the mirror saying you're going to be fine you're going to be fine And I was just like not with it and then I just came down. And I had a horrible rest of the night.\n",
            "Doctor: so you never\n",
            "Patient: No, I came down from it towards the end of the Red Cross session and said that I thought enough to stay out and that I just wasn't doing any more of it and I wasn't going to drink and I was just going to see my friends. I don't really remember really what we did. We went and had dinner and went to one of their apartments and I gave them the drugs and it was in that moment. I was like, I'm never doing that stuff again. I tried to do it once more when I went to Genevieve a couple weeks later for my semester abroad and while I was in I was like, maybe I'll give it one more shot because I really miss that feeling it gave me.\n",
            "Doctor: What feeling was that?\n",
            "Patient: Just like I'm like, it's the same feeling that I get now when I'm in the middle of a really good runner in the middle of a really good workout, and I have great music on and I have a high allergy and I can feel my muscles getting stronger, you know. It's like that like I just felt something awesome all I was on it. Like I just want to go dance and that's what we did. We would do cocaine and dance and it just made me feel like I was on top of the world. So I really remember really missing that feeling for a couple of years really missed feeling it gave you the feeling of gave me but I knew I could do it. So I didn't snore any of the in Genevieve's I just just tried to put a little bit on my gum, but Panic just set in Now I can't even like I used to smoke pot sometimes with my friends which kind of help calm me down and I can't even I can't do that anymore. It just makes me panic immediately when I was out in Oregon and one of them really has good friends has medical marijuana card for his anxiety. So she was like, why don't you just give it a try? I couldn't even I took in one. I inhaled once and then I had a panic attack.\n",
            "Doctor: So the Panic is about being poisoned.\n",
            "Patient: I felt like stuff that doesn't belong in. My body's going to kill me I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: That sounds very very scary.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean that they still and this was 6 years ago that day I can feel the way that I felt and it's horrible. It's fair and at this point, I don't even like I don't get like getting drunk, you know, I don't like being out of like being in control. I like feeling like I know what's going on and I can't roll what's going on. I felt really out of control that day like I couldn't stop what was happening.\n",
            "Doctor: How long have you done Coke for before that day?\n",
            "Patient: A year about a year not everyday mostly a couple times a week we would go out because that was the year. I wasn't drinking so it's so to me it was my substitute.\n",
            "Doctor: Were you drinking a lot before you started doing coke?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, not for too long. I didn't drink in high school. I definitely wasn't one of the popular kids who got invited to parties. And so there is a couple of times that my friends parents would go away and we would get some beer, you know and hang out in her house compared to what other kids were doing. I was a really good kid and high school. I smoked pot for the first time on my younger brother gave it to me the night before I went to college. He was hanging out with school friends in my grade, but when I got to college I started drinking a lot.\n",
            "Doctor: What did it do for you?\n",
            "Patient: I don't remember in freshman year. I mean I was a mess freshman year like it took me a year to get my shit together. I failed intro to psychology. I think I decided I want to be a psych major and some a psychologist and then I was going to have my private I had this whole plan. I wanted to have a private practice, you know, like pretty much be sitting in your chair right now. And then I remember I failed in intro to psych. I took it again. I got an A just be okay, like now I can move on, you know. But I just didn't know it was carried over from high school. I never I was never great a great academics in high school. I was average may be a little below but I just didn't try I didn't really care and I don't know why this is my mom asked me a lot now, like what was your deal should we get calls from teachers like healthy would be doing great job, but she just doesn't do her homework that carried into my freshman year. Like I just partied with my friends. I just didn't go to class. I remember I would help my friends like oh classes optional and I would sit in my room and hang out and watch something but I never really liked when I just didn't really try except for my women's studies class, which apparently I cared about and I did well in that class, but then I don't know what happened. sophomore year that change that because all the sudden it was all the The same time I start getting my weight under control. I mean granted I was starting doing drugs and I was on my way to potentially having an eating disorder. I started losing weight and even with all my GI problems, I made the Dean's List first semester sophomore year. I was in the library all the time. It helped that the girl I had a crush on was in the library all the time. It's in the library and not do her work. So I'll go to the library with her, but I would get it done. And I don't really know what changed but I just started. I don't know know what happened. I just came around and didn't get a decent, you know, but it took me a year. Yeah, my mom jokes around that she sent one kid off to Yale where I went to school and another one and got another one back because I changed so much throughout the four years. I was there.\n",
            "Doctor: So at the time you started doing better, is that when you started drinking?\n",
            "Patient: That's why I stopped drinking. Ants are doing cocaine. So yeah, it's weird because I can't be like, oh, I stopped drinking and started studying and exercising has a sister doing very very hard drugs and I was having health problems, but somehow I don't know what happened. I think I also started taking classes. I was interested in I think that has a lot to do like even now if I'm not interested in something is really hard for me to pay attention. I can speak it better at this point as an adult then I could I think in high school\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's more important to you to fake it probably.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I mean between those two years also made a lot of decisions, like personally I was going to confront my sexuality and I was starting to do that was starting to become more something but I couldn't ignore any more and I started dealing with it. I join the soccer team and it felt like I fit in finally likes about high school. I didn't really fit in feel like I said in freshman year still in really feel like I fit in because the people are I thought out to be friends with for the people that looks like the kids that went to my high school because that's where was familiar to me. I knew some of them. keep in touch with but they weren't who my real friends were, you know, I finally found out like a group of people that I set I just felt like so I think that maybe had something to do with it. I felt more comfortable in myself. I don't know if I was always looking for excuses to not be confident, you know, so I was like I'm not going to do well in school. I'm going to keep overeating.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sorry.\n",
            "Patient: No, that was just like the definite turning point though, like after freshman year when things really changed.\n",
            "Doctor: So you went from being quite disengaged to engaged.\n",
            "Patient: I don't really know how my drugs have it fits in with that because it doesn't really make much sense to me.\n",
            "Doctor: What made you interested in? It was someone just doing it and you figured you try it.\n",
            "Patient: first time I tried it was it was like almost a week of freshman year in The party and one of my friends had some I was really nervous. Like I was like this is going to hurt what's going to happen. It was that girl that I was like actuated with she was doing it. And so I was like, okay, I'll try it and I remember nothing happened. I didn't feel anything and I was like that's stupid. Like I don't feel it just because I had smoked pot throughout the year and liked it. So but like a can really freaked me out, you know, it's like that I've had always thought marijuana is with alcohol and then the rest of the drugs over here and I'm never going to touch them. Yeah, but I tried it and nothing happened and I remember I went to go hang out with my soccer friends and I was like, I just tried cocaine and nothing happened and they were pissed they want nothing to do with it and they didn't even want me to have anything to do with it bro my sophomore year. I never snorted cocaine around and I would lie to them and tell them I wasn't doing it and I had like my separate friends who are surprisingly now no longer my friends. Yeah, and then I didn't even think about it really all summer and it wasn't until I came back to school that those friends again. They had been doing it all summer. So they had it around so I give it another try. I guess I liked it. I don't really remember the second time. I did it.\n",
            "Doctor: It's hard to put the picture together in terms of your being more voting motivated in school and also doing drugs.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: People do take Coke to concentrate.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I remember there was one time we decide we tried it before class. And that was when after I did I was like, all right. I think this is when I noticed that my friend any who would like my cocaine buddy. I was like maybe we're on different pages with this if she's going to be doing this before class because at that point that was second semester, I made the Dean's List first semester. I was getting straight a second semester felt good to be getting good grades, and it's just I don't know cocaine was everywhere at my school. A lot of people did it and a lot of people go to the concentrate. A lot of the Frat Boys would take it to write their papers. And I remember people would be snorting it at the library. That was just never I don't know maybe because I figured out how To soberly succeed academically first semester that I don't know cocaine for me was after my papers. We're done and we were going to the bar.\n",
            "Doctor: as a recreation\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, when we did it before class and made me really uncomfortable. I was really uncomfortable in class felt like I couldn't concentrate cuz it's still and I was worried that everybody knew that I was high and I was like I was like I can't do it again. So it really stayed it stayed for me recreational. But when you're a college kid going out two or three nights a week, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: That's don't frequent.\n",
            "Patient: Is frequent enough, yeah\n",
            "Doctor: Were you ever worried about where you feeling you were getting really addicted or over your head?\n",
            "Patient: When we did it before class kind of sat back and re-evaluated how much I was doing it and whether is a good thing or a bad thing and I kind of had this bleeding clot. Like maybe I'm getting a little bit carried away, but I think I couldn't do it everyday and I couldn't do it every night because I wasn't a sleep so, you know, I didn't Tuesdays and Thursdays we had practice and Friday nights. We didn't go out because we had games every Saturday morning. So it wasn't like an option for me to do it on soccer days. I was still I was still as much as I like to party in the same went for pot in the same went for alcohol and marijuana again after I start drinking again. I stop doing cocaine for food to it's like a reward for working me. So after I finished with all my commitments and E2 Be done with my homework have gone to all of my classes and it's like fun time, you know. And I'm still kind of like that now I'll I'll be like okay, if you get this paper done, you'll have a drink tonight, you know, or I'll let myself go in a fancy sandwich or something, you know, like I don't know so it's always I still kind of had them separate but in retrospect, I think my exercise and eating habits Maybe. We're not out of control than my cocaine habit because they were spiraling farther and farther. They were constantly like I was constantly changing my location and hub. It was kind of constant except for one day when I did it before class, but it was kind of a consistent like I would just do it when I was out and then of course one day when I did all that because I was excited about it. I never did it again. But it wasn't something that was constantly escalating but more the weight. I lost in the faster. I could run in the farther I could run. The more I wanted to eat less and run farther. Do you know what I mean?\n",
            "Doctor: What stop that eventually?\n",
            "Patient: Going to Madagascar when I was in Madagascar. I probably gained seven or eight pounds back but I still look good for me because I was down to like under 19 before which is probably 10 lb less than I am right now. So I was probably like the size when I came home from Madagascar. I still felt good and I still felt like it looks good. But having been able to eat I was more conscious of how much I was exercising. So I was like, okay I'm going to eat more but I have to I'm going to exercise more it wasn't until I went abroad to Genevieve's that I really put the weight back on because I joined a soccer team team of the season ended early. So I pretty much stopped working out and started drinking again start been feeding.\n",
            "Doctor: Not eating but just binge eating.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah binge eating.\n",
            "Doctor: Was that what you were doing when you were overweight as a kid where you binge eating?\n",
            "Patient: But not in front of people I would do it when I was by myself.\n",
            "Doctor: like at night\n",
            "Patient: Is embarrassing for me? Yeah at night and that's when I went right back to the Habit in Genevieve living in a studio apartment by myself was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me at this point because I would go out and just like that I would go. Out with a backpack and go get all this food and come home. And just sit and watch TV or something. I didn't do any homework somehow. I still got a raise but I think that's what happens when you're abroad like it doesn't I don't know. I'm not sure if it was just the structure of my programs was more about experimental learning because I was still got fine grades, but I didn't do any homework then study at all. I would just like to eat.\n",
            "Doctor: When did your bin how old were you when you started been cheating?\n",
            "Patient: How do you remember I would always like kind of sneak things because my parents are hellfreaks. And so we are never allowed to eat all the fun stuff other kids got and when I was kind of like a chubby kid and my parents were like a my brother is like a stick him in my dad. So I take after my mom and he takes after my dad and he's six foot tall and I'm like a pinky so we would have Jamie snacks, but I wasn't allowed to eat them.\n",
            "Doctor: Jamie\n",
            "Patient: Jamie sorry, his name is Jamie like James.\n",
            "Doctor: James snacks\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like games He would have Cool Ranch Doritos, and I remember the Doritos and I wasn't allowed to eat the Doritos as much as he was.\n",
            "Doctor: Because he was thinner.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. My mom will deny this now. I think but Jamie remembers we were laughing about it the other day. I was just a slower metabolism than he does. And I feel like as a girl growing up. I was just a little bit, you know had more weight on me. So I started sneaking things. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think your parents knew?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: So, where would you get this?\n",
            "Patient: I would either when I was younger, I would usually just buy extra snacks from the cafeteria at school or I tell my mom I was making lunch money, but I would take more so I could get some extra snacks.\n",
            "Doctor: So you really thought about this this was plant.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah. Yeah, then once I could drive and high school, that's the end of it.\n",
            "Doctor: And so would you you would binge eat at night. Would you eat a little extra or would you be benching?\n",
            "Patient: I mean when I look back on it, I Feel like it was probably binging not to the extent when I was in Genevieve, but that that was really binging. I would go get three. Chamois sandwiches and french fries and just sit down and go to town when I was younger. Maybe it was or I would have extra meals. I feel like I remember these girls these good friends who I played softball with who were twins. They were really overweight to a we kind of like we just like to go to this 24-hour Deli would go there, you know like after we had already at dinner.\n",
            "Doctor: So that's more kind of social versus binge eating when you're alone.\n",
            "Patient: That's true. It was a mix of both. I mean one. I had found out that I had eaten buddies then we would just never eat health healthy, whatever we get together. We would order the worst food for you possible. But there was still this element of when I was at home like specially at night after everyone we go to sleep. I stayed up and watch TV and eat. I know that it is unhealthy because well, I mean it was unhealthy because I was very overweight. But I remember I would sit down and watch TV, but it wasn't to watch TV. It was easy. I would turn on the TV but then as soon as the food was done like I was watching done watching TV. I still have that habit now like when I eat lunch, If there's a weekend or something or I'm by myself, I'll eat even if I'm eating a salad. I'll sit down like I I'll sit down and I'll turn something on. TV Elite my salad or whatever I'm eating and then when the food's done, then I turn the TV off and I go back to work or something like that. I still kind of have that part of The Hobbit, you know, but\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know when you ate alone were you eating because you were lonely or were you sort of just looking forward to being on your own and eating?\n",
            "Patient: I so look forward to it. And that's why it's weird now. I don't have to look forward to having alone time because I used to look forward to it when I was by myself because that's when I would eat.\n",
            "Doctor: How would you feel after you ate?\n",
            "Patient: Not great.\n",
            "Doctor: Like physically or did you feel guilty?\n",
            "Patient: I think kind of guilty but then when I started having my stomach problems when I was 19, what would happen is I would wake up the mornings after eating late at night and B6 my stomach so it turned into a physical thing. But yeah, I would feel guilty. But if I kept eating then I didn't feel guilty when I start eating more and more and more because the longer I was eating for the longer it was going to be before I started feeling embarrassed and guilty. So I think that's what happened in Genevieve like the more food. I brought back my little Studio the longer I'd occupy myself eating it the longer I can have the periods of Happiness before I felt like oh God, I can't believe I just did that.\n",
            "Doctor: What you're describing it's sort of changed over time, but this very close relationship with your emotions with what you take in your body. And then sort of how you manage your emotions and it sort of Morphin something different now, but there's still that link now, it's developed into an anxiety around it and anxiety around what you're taking into your body, even though it doesn't sound like it's an anxiety with food, but it sounds like that one experience.\n",
            "Patient: I mean this week yes, but not usually now.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, not usually.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not I mean that one experience with Coke, I'm not surprised that it's it's like a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's like someone goes to war and you hear shells and then you hear a car alarm go off and you get\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You know and it sounds like you're having that experience with medicine or anything. That's you know, what you think of us for and in your body are potentially poison. It sounds like a traumatic reaction.\n",
            "Patient: I mean eating definitely does give me a bit of anxiety but not in the same way that medicine does so it's not like I'm eating that I can think something bad is going to happen today. It's just knowing because I always think. I'm still in a phase of Being Fit and being you know, like I'm not supposed to be skinny. Like I'm supposed to have meat on my bones and be strong and Kirby. So I don't think I'm skinny but fit always scared that I'm going to become that fax in again. And so I'm very very obsessed about what I eat a plan. I can plan my meals a lot but not like I portion control or make food the night before but I spend all day thinking about food.\n",
            "Doctor: Huh?\n",
            "Patient: I wake up in the morning. And the first thing I think is okay what I'm going to have for breakfast. What am I going to have it and then what am I going to have for lunch? And if we're going out for dinner? It's like okay what I'm going to have for breakfast and lunch that will make me feel okay eating steak for dinner or how many miles do I have to run before I let myself have some chips and guacamole if we're having tacos or something like that. I'll let myself eat things. Like I'll still go out for a burger and I still eat fries sometimes but I make sure that I feel like I deserve it.\n",
            "Doctor: So they're still it's helpful. We're going to need to stop. It's helpful to know that there's still that preoccupation with it. Okay. Well, I'll see you next week then.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah. Oh I brought my consent forms.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh great. Thank you.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I meant to give them to you at the beginning so you could record so now that I have a regular appointment you can just bill me at the end of the month.\n",
            "Doctor: Exactly. Great. Thank you so much.\n",
            "Patient: So there is both of them for you. This bag is great, but you can't just open and shut it to get something out.\n",
            "Doctor: Take care.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah YouTube.\n",
            "Doctor: I'll see you next week. Okay. Bye. Bye.\n",
            "Patient: The Weeknd\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hey.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not doing so well. Yeah, extremely sad. I'm getting ready for a job conference in a couple of days going to go hopefully have interviews.\n",
            "Doctor: What is this?\n",
            "Patient: It's does it teach me teacher placement agency called? They have conferences, you know, both Regional and kind of national. So this is for the national one and that's coming up on the 15th how I need to go to school. I'm not really entirely sure what I should be doing. I'm hoping for the best.\n",
            "Doctor: Huh?\n",
            "Patient: I'm hoping for the best. To me. I feel like I have teaching experience. I have a master's degree. I'm really good. Like I'm a really really good teacher.\n",
            "Doctor: That's pretty easy to believe.\n",
            "Patient: But it doesn't mean very much.\n",
            "Doctor: Well in one sense, I completely like I completely agree that in one sense. It doesn't mean.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Your point I gather is it doesn't really mean a damn bit of difference in any field.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'd like when it doesn't make very much difference in terms of what my chances are of getting a job.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I see I wasn't sure whether you meant surviving getting a job.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know about that. Then I have to see if the schools if they want to hire me. I'm unsure also aware. I'm going to be applying or where I should be applying and I don't. Play basically just applied at the area. Do I Go Everywhere? I don't know. My friend Candice was just visiting.\n",
            "Doctor: We must be quite difficult to know how to think about where Orient to work when you've been having such a disastrous time of it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Play Majid leave you a kind of loss to have to constantly think about work or a lot. of anything\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know what to do.\n",
            "Doctor: you don't really know what to do or how to talk about it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I don't know what to say.\n",
            "Doctor: Don't make a but you look now and of course you have it from other times recently almost like a kind of holding to yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't mean to make you feel so upset and subconscious, but I could imagine in a case something about how you're feeling. Maybe instead of what you want.\n",
            "Patient: aha\n",
            "Doctor: Because this mostly is what you been doing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I'm just barely.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and you feel like like catatonically.\n",
            "Patient: Something like that.\n",
            "Doctor: You didn't quite shut down.\n",
            "Patient: I just felt sad. I don't know how to function. I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: Feel It In Like A Very physical way where\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: You feel it in any differently here than like at home.\n",
            "Patient: I guess about the same very tired.\n",
            "Doctor: To me. There's something quite important about how difficult it is to sort of put any words do it.\n",
            "Patient: apparently difficult\n",
            "Doctor: In fact, actually when you said those it was actually kind of difficult to be feeling it and kind of clearly in touch with it and talking about anything at all.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Or maybe I just don't have anything to say yet.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess there are things that occur to me to ask when you describe you use the word sad that doesn't sound like it's clear that goes with the sense of a loss or a longing or being upset by something.\n",
            "Patient: I know.\n",
            "Doctor: or being beat\n",
            "Patient: I do feel beat.\n",
            "Doctor: be more like wind down or be more like not like you don't have to anything to fight in you.\n",
            "Patient: I just feel like I've been repeatedly punched in the jaw like beat up just tired.\n",
            "Doctor: I think I suppose it has seemed to me at times like your depression is slipping into a sort of this kick the shit out of you in every possible way and if he everything you try to do.\n",
            "Patient: I just\n",
            "Doctor: How it happened? why no one idea that I had about it that I kind of got at the moment is like it makes me think in a way a certain kind of demonic Obsession and which the more you pay attention to the depression as such and kind of do something about it the angry and more vengeful the demon gets and the more you have people around trying to make contact with the part of you that is hurting so terribly and so sad and so troubled by what's going on and you're angry even yet and the next question for me is why why would you be so dead set against feeling better against what's really going on in again what it's really like and I'm not sure but probably has something to do with some kind of very profound like lost that you feel and that sort of having people to be closer actually makes you feel more so\n",
            "Patient: okay\n",
            "Doctor: When is a sample of the first part that's coming to mind is from a couple of weeks ago 3 weeks ago. Maybe now it was that Tuesday when you I think he must be when you and I met and you had an easy tea and then you kind of decided after that that you really needed to be in the hospital when we have talked. You were hopeful that the ECT would help you feel better and that it didn't do you remember at all?\n",
            "Patient: yeah\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I have my facts straight on it because I remember thinking about the time you had said to me that day as well when you're done with it before it seemed like the ECT was helping not such a pain to sleep, but it was making a difference you thought.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah now I remember that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and then you're feeling really crummy that morning your were like I'm going to have an ECT and I had asked does it tend to help right away or does it take awhile? And I think you referred to their being kind of lift usually fairly soon after we didn't talk until a day or late or later a day or maybe two later maybe three because you were back in the hospital. But if I recall you made it clear that you didn't feel any better you couldn't have if you know, the decision was made talking to a doctor there that you really needed to be back in the hospital and that was the best thing and I remember thinking of the time gosh it almost kind of It almost like you kind of had to show yourself. It wasn't working over the depression. It could be stronger. I know it probably sounds a little bit crazy thing to say, but it was almost like, you know, you were starting to lean on a little bit and he started to appreciate getting some help on this and it's almost like you kind of had to make a point that showing you that it wasn't going to work. It wasn't going to work. It was that day, you know, I mean, it doesn't in a way mean that it doesn't help at all or can't help but I think it away and maybe kind of determined to show that it wasn't going to be stronger than the depression.\n",
            "Patient: That makes sense.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean the why question I'm more speculative about like I wonder things like historically is there a way that started being depressed growing up was one of the truest things you can do, you know, like, you know, what other ways you sort of complying and trying to be or like find at least not to make noise or maybe sort of I don't know. Maybe you felt like pretty in the Machinery there. I'm feeling pretty powerless. And you know, I wonder if being depressed is one of the ways you can kind of be honest and also show that and also in a weight be very powerful that nobody is going to take that away.\n",
            "Patient: That's for sure. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: We're going to stop in a minute, but I was just checking with you about the whatever more or less about this.\n",
            "Patient: About the same. I made it through it.\n",
            "Doctor: Turned out pretty hard. Yes.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm struggling.\n",
            "Doctor: When did Candace leave?\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: When did Candace leave?\n",
            "Patient: yesterday\n",
            "Doctor: You went in today?\n",
            "Patient: Turn around Mike.\n",
            "Doctor: Was it bad for you were things bad last night?\n",
            "Patient: No, they weren't so bad.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: That's fine.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Well, I'll call you.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, how are you doing? No.\n",
            "Patient: It smells like somebody got sick or Victor something.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, it's a tissues the tissues with Vicks in them. I don't like them.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, you got a bunch of them?\n",
            "Doctor: I think I have some others.\n",
            "Patient: What lotion do they make slime with cereal as well? Write something like that, you know shovel the snow as well. Let's see. What did we talked about last time? It was quite significant, right? Oh, yeah the need to protect my mom. Well, I guess after that like if you feel you want to protect someone does that in your head make them feel or seem like the Catalyst. I don't know if that is a connection that's mainly in my head or not. It's funny like this didn't even occur to me until now that you know, why does she have to listen to all that view? Why couldn't why couldn't she have stood up for herself? And you know, I told him to shut up and you know last name, why does she keep you know, I don't know what you know kind of general and everyone feels and what is peculiar to me and I should think of getting rid of of thinking differently about I guess, you know, everyone would want to everyone was so protective about their parents in the people that love but I guess I my case it feels I guess it feels helpless maybe and I don't really trust her to do things for herself. I don't know and when she does do something by ourselves, then you know, I'm pleasantly surprised. Well, you don't need my help. That's a really I guess it's just like how a parent feels when they're bringing up a child. Finally. She went to the potty by herself or something like that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, but that assumes that the child will develop into an independent adults.\n",
            "Patient: What I probably assume that.\n",
            "Doctor: with your mother\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What is the mechanism in which by what she'll change?\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, why do you assume that the way your mother is now won't be the way she'll be in the future.\n",
            "Patient: I suppose I let you know we're all we're both in a trajectory of growth or you know, trying to achieve something and she with her teaching license and me with that, you know, like writing themselves. So I feel like both of us will you know, she will, you know, eventually get the lay of the land or something in order to not yeah, maybe that makes me think that you know, she's on a trajectory of changed the most people think otherwise, they think that this is where we are. This is how it will always be you or\n",
            "Doctor: It depends on the person.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And yes, and because you're growing and changing and reflecting on your life and thinking about you know, how you want to grow that you know, your mom won't because you see that she that the two of you as so low tide.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe yeah, when was the reflection of the other may be enough for myself? I want to change and I want things and go on to achieve certain things and I'm hoping you know those achievements will make me more positive more confident person to have your person. I guess I'm assuming and hoping for the same for my mom. I just asked the way I think of it me. A work-in-progress. Yeah, it's you know, I mean, I think that's the word transition and it's because we're here and you know immigrants I kind of I don't know if I would have felt as an Indian. The thing is that adds to the sentiment patients that I have is myself mostly and my mom to just get there already perhaps I think that you are the only people who transitioning or trying to achieve something. I think others already have it even though now I'm beginning to see but not feel that like, you know, they're already actually also trying to get somewhere.\n",
            "Doctor: If it were true that everybody's already gotten so, you know gone to where they wanted. You would be my only patient.\n",
            "Patient: Really?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, don't you think people come to therapy? Because they want to be something more than a different than they are now oils with people come.\n",
            "Patient: Probably everything people come to their depressing memes there in a place. They don't want to be changed his thoughts and feelings may be like situations. I guess. I don't know why I feel like I should just you know without hard work and all of that just you know, make it magically and sensible. Oh, yes, and I don't know. I just don't understand why people are very positive. It's like why are you so why do you have such a good solid realistic Sans and why you get through yesterday? I went to school and had to meet the professor. My professor is a writer. How do you say very teacher good teacher writing, but if only I could get him to focus. I think I could learn something from him. He kind of asked me about my background and I really didn't want to share and after I told him no, I mean a little bit Oh, I think I could learn something from him. He can I mean a little bit a few things. I just felt really bad about myself, you know ashamed. Yes, you know me questions. Okay. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing that in class? He was like, do you guys, you know hang out together more? I was thinking he has no idea about the sense of resentment some of us may feel for each other. You know what maybe I sent another actually nice and happy with each other. I roll my eyes at you like a clear distinction between Rider course, you don't have to work and writers he doing why you should think that I'm so proud and I thought, you know, like very pathetic about myself. I'm like, yeah, I'm working. I came to this country since I was 15. So I was like kind of you to take that into account that's not important to me at all that I were despised that I despise those years. I don't know why I'm such a childish about this is that the right word adjectives.\n",
            "Doctor: Alice What how do you describe as childish?\n",
            "Patient: Use the wrong word.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you think you was trying to say to you?\n",
            "Patient: I should be I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, that's why I'm asking because I don't know what you're trying to say to you.\n",
            "Patient: He said take an account that you'll have to work. It's like you said those who you know live off trust funds and don't have to work on those who have to work. He was just saying be appreciative, you know writers these days live in the Boston and trying to make it trying to write because it's so expensive here and this and that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I do understand where he was going with that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know what it means to take into account.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know what it means?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, how am I supposed to take it into account? Keep telling myself? That's okay. This is not a very nice consolation prize. I like the website. You almost said. Yes. I thought that it said yes, but it said now it's just in the back of my head. I'm feeling you know, what you guys are just using you know, what you don't care one bit about what I'm really want and I just need to send five or six emails everyday do this do that. Do this do that. It's like, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: To the website that you volunteered for.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like the mule or you know, like a beast of burden just carrying on without really having a say in it.\n",
            "Doctor: Why did you volunteer?\n",
            "Patient: I thought so angry so wrong to hearing that. I was led to believe that they are accepted it and then suddenly they said no and so I just felt really wrong. I think he said that I felt like something that was given to me had been taken away or something and then instead crying and eating myself. I just yeah, I guess that I thought they were saying they're so busy and all that. Maybe I'll relieve their burden and do something nice for that. I'm just get to know, you know this horrible monsters and you know, they're heartless group in mind that you know, so and that's what they look like. You know, let's see it from their eyes. Maybe I'll learn something.\n",
            "Doctor: well, then you feel taken advantage of\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know. I just feel like I mean see that as a negative thought process that I should learn how to avoid I volunteered and I was thinking with will this take too much of my time. And you know, I just went ahead and did it. So now I shouldn't regret it or not like beat myself up over it. I should learn to manage and I should you not learn to speak out for myself. Like, you know, I cannot help you these days. I'm busy and I'm feeling so wrong and then taken advantage of because you know, I knew what I was getting into.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, how did I'm infuriated in them with them translate to in 200 I'll work for you for free.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know the feeling in my head.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm trying to understand that link.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It's just automatic.\n",
            "Doctor: Usually people you feel wronged by an angry with you. Don't then ask volunteer to help.\n",
            "Patient: I can't explain it because that's just how I think or thought of that time purple just starting any everything on me and the emails. They said that they needed help with the website not addressing me. It was like an internal conversation and that person is forwarded to me. Yeah, I mean, like I said, I thought that if I relieve them of some of the burden then they'll sometimes will free up or they'll you know take pity on me and or not pretty but you know, like I'm feel obliged to reconsider reread a revision or they'll just see that I'm a nice person. Maybe I don't know yet that stinky. Yeah, like if someone you're angry with And it has maybe wrong you actually not, you know, just in your head runs you but actually runs you if they had a very kind of thinking like, you know, you made them feel bad for you you appeal to their conscious. I'd like to think.\n",
            "Doctor: You make them feel guilty.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, perhaps are you appeal to their kindness?\n",
            "Doctor: What do monsters have kindness?\n",
            "Patient: Is there monsters in my head I made them monsters are not actually monsters. Right? I said those words what they're really are monsters, aren't they? Like my dad, you know, there's no need to appeal to this anyting perhaps only two, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: And there was originally a piece of writing that you submitted right? So they're supposed to reconsider your writing cuz you're helping them out. It seems like apples and oranges.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know but so they said that to resubmit and so when I do resubmit it wouldn't just oh well, who is this? It's the women who was giving us the fusible website, you know, there will be that sense of obligation a little bit. Right? I mean, they won't just go read the peace differently, I think.\n",
            "Doctor: Then you have this feel bad or wonder whether they're publishing your peace based on the Merit versus guilt. How could you ever know?\n",
            "Patient: At this point I don't care. I feel like I'm convinced of this mad because I have commitment I shouldn't say that. Well, like, you know people have like other writers and like readers and liked it. So I know it's on Merritt that is important to be. Oh, yeah. It's so much of what gets published doesn't mean the PDF of the latest version the person that I was supposed to be and it's all mostly their friends. So, you know, it's whatever, you know, they all think they're you know, they launched a website launched a magazine that is going to be so so you got to work and you know, I'm giving voice to writers who are writing important things who are those Riders their their friends. So at this point I don't care if they get out of guilt or obligation or relief or like\n",
            "Doctor: So you would like you're hoping to put them in a position where they don't feel they have a choice.\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm not sure that the choice I mean.\n",
            "Doctor: well less obituaries\n",
            "Patient: No, I mean.\n",
            "Doctor: So if you feel obligated to someone then you have less of a choice by definition.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, perhaps know it's really is just in my head that I wanted to know them because if I didn't get to know them better, I'll think all the editors will just continue to be heartless monsters in my head. So I wanted to rid myself of that word assumption.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you?\n",
            "Patient: I don't I haven't got to know them that well, I think I'm getting better very slowly.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you see them as kind?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they are.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you see them?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know them that well at all actually.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you see them as less monster than you did before?\n",
            "Patient: Probably not. I see them is more helpful since I really don't know anything about technology and all these things in my eye on all these ideas in my mind and no idea how to do them and what other their feasible or not. It just makes me feel very bad because I mean the whole friends thing looking at whoever else are you going to solicit the right there and you seen the writing and you like them or maybe you feel like in different ways, but I don't know it I just feel like there is no space for my voice, you know, like I mean, of course, you know, like Americans are going to want to read stuff written by Americans other Americans, but then it just feels like when will I get to be the commentator, you know, like I'm also writing about immigrants live and you know, like most people their publishing are American and then we need that, you know, it just feels like you know, you're not going to be a part of that thing you feel excluded all the time. So yeah, I don't know if I see them losses monsters. I don't know if I'd resubmit. I just want to get done with the website and do my own stuff at the time.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think you offered your help because you're hoping to be included by those who excluded you?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was funny kind of relationship and I have not just with them but like the other things at large I just you know, I felt excluded for so long that then I also had this other contradictory feeling now, if you know, I don't know if I want to be in you know, because the whole like the few meetings that I have with them about the website and a one-time the guy said, oh I should invited you to the kid next time and we have a party or something and then I just kind of went since I was like, oh, I don't know if I want to do that. So I want to be included and I don't want to be included. I feel like they will take away my uniqueness or the things that makes me or something. I don't want to lose it. I guess that's a fair somewhere feeling that I have about traveling in the US. I don't really like to do it. I don't want to go on long drives like driving down the highway experience.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you like about it?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know just so monotonous. I feel really affected by its like the death by landscape. Yeah, and I feel even more wrong when I think of my mom and me and like us together struggling and wanting and me wanting to represent struggle with words and having included in the larger narrative American life and that not being you know, so I feel wrong.\n",
            "Doctor: Play flogging to those who exclude you you're just perpetuating the narrative.\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: will be wanting by seek and approval from those who have already disapproved of you that's just perpetuating The Narrative it's not changing\n",
            "Patient: So are you suggesting I should submit them or?\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not suggesting what you should or shouldn't do I'm just jesting what will your behavior and thoughts mean\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm watching this position and I don't know what to do or change it. I would really like to change it because I don't think I would succeed before I have to inject. I just want to see my own faults and they are they're not just behave early but in my writing my professor took one look at the first couple paragraphs and was like, oh this story is great. You have to do this to make the language better. So it's like they're there their objective and I just want just don't see the them and the University was the first time that I actually felt very included my God. I was so spoiled. I was really really spoiled because like the teacher really like my work and they gave me that award and then I said, oh I'm going to drop out. I can't pay my fees. They gave me 5000 to be able to finish and I was really just I was just at the Center of My Universe.\n",
            "Doctor: How did it feel?\n",
            "Patient: Very good. I was you know on cloud nine because I was pampered appreciated and loved I was blinded by all the love. I can see the others the fact I mean I could and you know, there was all this politics People Reno King's favorites and all that but I hear it. I have a cremation, you know, you're not so much because you know, I've already been disillusioned and I'm kind of carrying that disillusion with me. So and I am very I don't know why you're gone. I can see the others and I can see the good in their writing and then had the sense of you guys are American obviously a very quickly because you're actually are the narrative, you know, you weren't invited. I have to kind of do acrobatics in bed myself in weird ways to seam or to show that I belong or are you now, I have something interesting to say I was thinking that yesterday. I felt very bad that I was thinking that way.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't agree with you though. I mean, you know more about the writing world, but I think that in your current experience speak so many Americans it's a land of immigrants.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I agree. That's what I would say. But then why is it that people don't want to read about it?\n",
            "Doctor: Why do you say that?\n",
            "Patient: because there's a lot of stuff the stuff that gets published mostly from Americans not from like immigrants like, you know, Asian Americans or you know,\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. It seems like Americans are very interested in the Immigrant experience. And if you look up percentages, I mean part of it is probably a percentage the number of people who submit you are from the US or born in the US vs. Asian Americans. I'm sure the percentage is pretty low may be represented in the publishing versus, you know in terms of the initial population.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, I would like to see that makes me feel very debilitated. I would think the other way because it's stuff that I cannot change myself except through improving my writing.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess maybe the larger point being that there are ways to see got the narrative. I mean in a way talking or taking on his magazine or this what magazine is like? Yeah. I mean it's seeking out the narrative secant validation in The Narrative of being excluded or being wrong and the only Power you feel has to make the other people feel a change you that's the only way in which you feel empowered.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. No, I don't think that I've changed be like that's the reason why I'm feeling sad because that's my professor said yesterday making a website will not result in publication, you know, it will result in contacts but not in publication and I know I mean that's why I don't even know if I'll submit it again because then they'll think of now, you know, she will think we're obligated to her which you know, I don't feel that at all. I just feel like I said, I just think I wonder if they're reading a piece a second time and if at least I have done the changes that make it more powerful in the other language and all the issues are taken care of then they'll know that the piece was written not when stranger because that makes it very easy for you to reject if it's bad, you know, but the certain he does On the Border, you know, because I feel like now I've been on the board for a long time it really is. Like it. It's like coming to Mexico and not being close to the Border. But now I'm on the fence so they will see that okay. It's not mean this person is someone who has helped out. Is writing that I'm at fault in instead of out and if it is and if indeed I fall out, maybe they will they will give me some feedback as to how I could be and you know, I don't know like this piece is not even that important to me because you not working on my model and it would have been so nice to have a magazine publication.\n",
            "Doctor: Feels like it's not a Perfect Analogy, but you're sort of switching roles with your your started becoming your mother's roll dice a b the magazine soda lying to someone feel obligated to you to give you a second chance to feel like they might owe you something if it's only sort of take your you know, what your Notch up your peace a little bit about other people because they think not only do they know you but you help them you given them three times.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so they're supposed to be my mother.\n",
            "Doctor: No, you're making someone feel obligated to you.\n",
            "Patient: Like my mother makes me feel.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, like her handing you over the bell for the rent. How can you cast me out so quickly you owe me.\n",
            "Patient: That's a negative way of thinking and damaging and everything.\n",
            "Doctor: No, I'm stirring it is I think it's really healthy. I think we should continue helping you. What kind of question is that?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know if the patient is concerned house to she wants to know how sick she is. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you want to know that about yourself?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I should.\n",
            "Doctor: No. Ever do that. Well, it sounds like what you're saying is that you're anxious those questions and part come out of anxiety.\n",
            "Patient: About what?\n",
            "Doctor: On this case being sick.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean I'm so deep into it that I don't completely know that yes, I'm strong. So now that you kind of I think what you're saying is wrong and maybe I will be able to get out of it.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's very limiting and it makes me feel terrible.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: This whole scenario. I mean, it sounds like you feel miserable with this volunteering. Is that something that brings you joy and pleasure or makes you feel good about yourself.\n",
            "Patient: It does actually a little bit just because I'm really good at it and they are very happy with it. And they're encouraging are there saying, you know good job with that. You know, there is that there is a affirmation I feel good probably doing it. But then when this negative thinking comes into being that oh, you know, they're just using me they wouldn't want to publish me. This is when I feel miserable. I mean, you're right. I do feel miserable, but I have that positive sense as well.\n",
            "Doctor: I think we need to stop for today.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I will see you on Monday.\n",
            "Patient: Is that insurance thing?\n",
            "Doctor: Did you call them?\n",
            "Patient: I did. It's just impossible to get through to them because all I could do was leave them a message about my personal changed her about my address changed and I don't even know if they processed it. I didn't even get to talk to a person.\n",
            "Doctor: We'll figure it out. I know it's really hard. Thank you for doing that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'll keep trying.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, I'm one of the psychiatrist to work you on the department of psychological medicine and you are.\n",
            "Patient: healer\n",
            "Doctor: I have spoken with your physician doctor white and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today. However, I would like to hear from you and why you have come to see me today.\n",
            "Patient: Sleeping well, I should say I don't want to sleep sleep brings Night Nurse with it and I have the same nightmare over and over. I was wondering if I could get something to help me sleep and forget past events.\n",
            "Doctor: Doctor white also indicated that you're having some other concerns. Would you like to tell me about your concerns other than sleep I would also add that if you have questions or don't understand something at any point during this interview, please feel free to ask me for a clarification. Are you comfortable telling me about your trouble specifically?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I would like to get your help because I feel like I can't live my life. I'm not wanting to be around groups of people. I feel irritable and have been having trouble trouble concentrating and remembering things. I don't have an appetite and feel nauseated a lot lately. I'm 28 years old and feel like an old lady.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you tell me when these symptoms started?\n",
            "Patient: Really? I have had nightmares for years throughout my childhood. And now I'm 28 and still having them and never like sleep and try to avoid it and need only about 5 hours a night so anxious and irritable feelings have increased more in the last few months, I guess. I noticed my nausea and loss of appetite since the separation from my husband and since moving into my grandparents his house again.\n",
            "Doctor: Is there something a change within your life for a trigger that occurred that you recall before the symptoms? Began? Are you having any distressing memory is that you coming back or maybe a situation where you feel scared or really want to avoid?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I have just moved back to town this last year with me two young daughters. I'm living at my grandparents house. They have both passed. I noticed after I move and that I don't feel settled and I have the symptoms. I just spoke of\n",
            "Doctor: Do you ever have times of great fear or have panic attacks? Do you drink alcohol smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs?\n",
            "Patient: I believe this all began with a panic attack I thought I was having a heart issues but realize that I was having a panic attack I just figured it was due to the split with my husband and moving back to my hometown and into the old house I smoked cigarettes a pack a day started when I quit alcohol I went through treatment for my drinking and have been sober for eight years. No drug used. Otherwise.\n",
            "Doctor: That is great that you have been sober for eight years. Do you have specific memories of this house as a child, are there any memories of pleasure or fear?\n",
            "Patient: I love my grandparents as a child. I love this house except for the basement. I used to have to play with my cousin the basement. He was not a nice person five years older than me and likes to teach me all sorts of things sexual things. I was only five at the time and didn't understand. I felt dirty and ashamed I didn't tell anyone until I was an adult. I've gone to counseling for this as an adult. No one else knows.\n",
            "Doctor: Your family does not know about this abuse from your cousin.\n",
            "Patient: No, no way. I told the counselor once I can't tell them because it would all because all it would do is cause pain for the family. It's over and done and I just want to move on with my life. I have just separated from my husband and want to move on with my life.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know about family history or any mental illness or other medical issues?\n",
            "Patient: My mom was depressed and has issues. She's never been treated. My dad is fine. No problems. No other medical issues that I know of.\n",
            "Doctor: Was your husband physically or emotionally mentally abusive to you?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, emotionally and mentally not always but we just couldn't seem to work things out. I grew up with my step dad abusing my mom. So I recognize the cycle and I didn't want to get to the physical abuse stage.\n",
            "Doctor: Has anyone else sexually or physically abused you?\n",
            "Patient: Just my cousin. My mom was pretty physical. She would get beat then ask kids would get beat. It was just messed up. I am on my own now and away from all of that.\n",
            "Doctor: What about your children? Have they been exposed to any of uses?\n",
            "Patient: No way. I make sure that they are not left with anyone other than my sister and my grandmother when she was alive. They don't have sleepovers and they know about Good and Bad Touch.\n",
            "Doctor: How old are your daughters?\n",
            "Patient: What is 5 + 1 is 7 they are good girls.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think the ages of your daughters May trigger some of your memories?\n",
            "Patient: Probably they are so small and innocent. I can't go there.\n",
            "Doctor: How about mental or emotional abuse? Did you experience either or both of these?\n",
            "Patient: My mom was a yeller and through things she cursed a lot and was not a happy person. She had me when she was 16. So we always kind of clashed. My husband was also a yeller and controller he means to protect me, but it goes too far.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you had other therapy or medications in the past? Perhaps when you saw the counselors in the past?\n",
            "Patient: No medications and just basically talks about things that have happened in the past. Sometimes I feel stuck and need to talk to my counselor if that makes sense.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, it does and that is a healthy action to take how about your irritability and memory issues I mentioned earlier. Can you tell me more specifically about the symptoms?\n",
            "Patient: I feel that I have less patience with my daughters and I also feel that I space out more having a hard time concentrating and sticking with tasks. I find myself wanting to go drive with the girls, you know, just get in the car and drive. It just feels confining in the house all the time, but I don't want to be around Bunches of people.\n",
            "Doctor: how do you spell depressed\n",
            "Patient: I have always been mildly more sad than usual. I guess lately. I feel like I am suffocating and like I need space. I want to be alone.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you had feelings of suicide or homicide?\n",
            "Patient: No suicide was a thought as I was growing up, but I can't leave my girls when my parents divorced. I wanted to die and later when they both remarried. I've talked to my counselor about that to the suicide stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you or have you ever had a suicide plan?\n",
            "Patient: I used to when I was a teenager, I would take a bunch of pills or just get into my mom's car and turn it on and go to sleep in the close-up garage. That was when I was in junior high and high school. I couldn't leave my girls though.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you notice any symptoms or feeling jumping and anxious?\n",
            "Patient: We're so in my grandparents house. I had the panic attack and I don't feel entirely safe in the house. I just figured I was not used to living on my own. I'm scared of something happening to my daughters and I will not be able to protect them. I wake up from my nightmares and feel and over and overwhelming sense that I can't protect them. I go check on them after my heart slows and my shaking quits from The Nightmare.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you talk about the nightmares are they the same or different?\n",
            "Patient: They are mostly the same. Someone is in the house chasing me and I need to save my family before he gets to them and kills us all they are dark dreams don't share with anyone outside of counseling. I learned my dreams were not normal dreams when I was growing up. My friends would look petrified as I told them about the killing chasing and fear. I wake up in a sweat out of breath and my heart racing. I done must get up and sit for a bit so I don't go back into the same dream.\n",
            "Doctor: 5 hours of sleep is your average you say do you nap during the day?\n",
            "Patient: No, not to bring on very bad dreams some of the worst. I avoid napping. I also work at an insurance office and don't have time to sleep more than I do.\n",

            "Patient: I worry about my daughter's being harmed. Like I was I also worried about how the separation with my husband will affect them. But my parents divorced it was devastating to me. My life just went downhill.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you tell me more about what you mean by your life Went Down Show?\n",
            "Patient: My Mom married an alcoholic that beat her and then she beat us the cops were at our house a lot to break up the fighting. It was embarrassing. We didn't eat well or often and I usually cooked for my sister and brother because my mom and stepdad were at the bar. We ate a lot of Pancakes. It was all I knew how to cook at 9 years old in the batteries cheap. I missed my dad. He never raised his voice or hit me one. He was the opposite of my stepdad. We moved every year. I was in school sometimes across the street or sometimes across town. I got behind in school because of changing so many times and I learned to not get too close to friends.\n",
            "Doctor: Where is the test called the ace study adverse childhood experiences study? Have you ever heard of the study or taking any test for depression?\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you taking any test for depression or trauma?\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you hurt a post-traumatic stress disorder?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, when soldiers come home and have a hard time adapting back into normal life, right?\n",
            "Doctor: That is correct. There are other situations where people can have PTSD. So just traumatic stressful events such as car accidents living through a natural disaster witnessing traumatic events or living in abusive situations. There are some key symptoms such as re-experiencing the event arousal or hyper-vigilance and avoidance. These are symptoms. We have discussed today and we could come to me with treatment options if you are interested.\n",
            "Patient: I am interested. I need to not feel so scared and worn out what types of treatment do I have to get my mom or dad involved because I don't want to do that, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: No, everything here is confidential. There is a therapy that we could start called prolonged exposure therapy, which is just looking at the memories in a safe environment and trying to retrain Pathways in your brain. We could also look at some medications for anxiety and depression. Does this sound like something you would like to pursue?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I will try.\n",
            "Doctor: We're going to have some lab work done before we look at medications and we will be in treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: How are you? What do?\n",
            "Patient: Alright, thank you. Excuse me. I had my nice yesterday. What's the school is over for the semester but I wanted longer it probably kind of feels like I miss that structure but I'm kind of a little sad about Peter Department. I went to see my roommate yesterday and she said she keeps they keep finding people but for some reason these people don't want my room. So I've already paid for the December rent without actually living there and I've paid for the January rent. Also, I feel really bad about this just working out $800 is $900 a month without like sort of just wasted. So I mean the reason why I wanted to leave the place, I mean we talked about all of the psychological subconscious reasons, but the Practical thing that I was thinking was there was already someone who was interested. So I kept thinking about her and thinking of saving that money or giving it to my mom So then when I finally decided to me. Place, I asked that girl and she was still interested. That's why I asked my roommate to see if they would be a good fit and they're not and I was like I was a little upset by that because Alana's like yeah, the girl is a little pushy and I'm thinking she can't be any pushier than me or when do you guys actually see each other? Not that often. It was kind of lonely in that place because I wouldn't see my roommates for days and there's such little interaction time. Why does it matter that the person you don't really see that often is pushy? I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you looking for someone to replace you too?\n",
            "Patient: I cannot because\n",
            "Doctor: Why?\n",
            "Patient: I cannot do anything because they're the ones who have to live with the person.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: So I'm not allowed to do anything. I mean, I know I sign the lease I'm responsible for the rent and obviously I'll pay it but just makes me feel a little bad for so they're all the they reject to get a lot of interest but then they reject people and one of the guys they rejected because he was upset that they that people mispronounce his name. I don't know. Well yesterday. I was feeling really really horrible. I was walking around the streets crying just I just and I was actually aware of what I was doing. I was thinking of Andre thinking and rethinking the same things and I was feeling so victimized and like what we talked about having that narrative constantly debilitate me. And I kept thinking all the odds are against me and well in the morning, I was on Facebook and one of the people I met a while ago, she's an artist she has drawing and yesterday someone posted her interview in this National newspaper in India. And I I mean, I like that girl a lot but a part of me was when am I going to make a little something of myself that I'm proud of and she's created this bubble. This Enchanted world where she does her art, but I'm not sure there are other parts to it. I'm sure she's had to struggle and she's had to accept that. She's not going to have too much money, but I just feel when am I going to be able to make that happen every time I try for something else goes wrong or something else happens and makes me feel bad. I guess another way of looking at it is that I react to situations in a negative way. I don't know. I mean, what's the point of always be thinking about that person that had such a nice childhood and like and their parents are nice and they can go home and be with their parents and lean on them anytime they want to and I don't have that. I mean, okay, I don't have that much except that it's a given a move on. I mean, that's what David would like me to do. So but I don't know. Why do I keep doing that? I mean, I guess I look at other people to draw lessons from their life. How did they do it? How did they ignore all the crap and do what they want to do? I'm always looking for that. But I also end up looking at though they have this thing that I never had that cannot. I cannot do anything about so ivy Compare ourselves to each other all the time, right or that's like some people like me who are insecure do that. I'll do it more often. I mean\n",
            "Doctor: That's true.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I was asking him but I was like because he knew this girl too and I was like, so just to make this clear you have absolutely you feel absolutely nothing negative when I tell you about her entry. He's like yeah, I don't know Mike. Wow, I'm like totally insecure and you're like and I mean, he's like no I know what I have to get done and I'm like, how can you not feel like what you're doing might not be a significant or as popular as what she's doing and you don't think that way it's like well, I wish I could just be just a little bit like that would always be insecure or will I be able to feel a little secure myself?\n",
            "Doctor: You're not sure. You're not sure.\n",
            "Patient: No right now, I'm not.\n",
            "Doctor: Because you're feeling especially insecure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess I mean, I'm sure I I'm trying to think if there were times in my life where I was less insecure, but I don't know I might have been but I might have still been insecure about other things even as a child as like to stop going to Facebook. Stop looking at like deliberately torture yourself. Like I'll start Facebook in the morning so I can feel bad all day, but he's right about that then I'm like, but I have to develop those impulses and so I can be emotionally strong and look at those things objectively and he's like well until you do. You should I don't know. But I should say was changed or maybe it's I don't want to jinx it. But and I hope it's true there but I'm learning that thing about what I'm feeling is temporary. I don't know. I hope it's true because previously all these things I'm feeling I would feel them so intensely and I would just be totally in the moment and then it's Victor says that there were just be dishonest abundant present and no regard for there is a past or if they're well regard for the past definitely but no regard for the future, but I think my thinking is opening in that direction a little bit and I actually do you like or a sense that oh, I guess I'm sad right now and it feels awful, but maybe I won't feel so awful a few hours or a few days. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: That's quite a change.\n",
            "Patient: Is it it's a small I don't know. I want to be like it's there but I do I mean I was feeling I was very very sad yesterday. I mean, sad enough to cry and not even realizing that I'm out in public. But yeah today I wouldn't feel like crying and I don't know maybe I just don't know how to be secure just in myself. I feel like I need a set of legitimate treatments be able to build on my sense of being on that my sense of self. I mean if I did nothing at all. I don't know. I don't feel like I should deserve to feel the chair and just the knowledge that I am that I exist. I don't know. I want to play the blame game, but I'm like did this come from a did this sense of you have to do something you have to do something. Otherwise, it's awful. I wonder if this comes from David.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's also the reason you seek him out.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah yesterday I had this dream. And this is like I never dream about him. So it's very strange. But I had this dream that we were in the room in this place. It looks very normal, but it's a game where it's a horror movie free listings. Are they left on their own and there's a glass or something and I was behind when he was putting those things out because he knew how to do it or maybe a sense from us playing Angry Birds too much, but I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: So can you say the dream again?\n",
            "Patient: Oh just stuff you with stuff and there's a glass or something horrible happens and I was on his arm and I was next to him and he was going ahead and defusing the stuff. We're doing it the right way because he knew how to\n",
            "Doctor: diffuse the explosion\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And what were like what was the explosion was like in a box?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It was like furniture or something and suddenly it looks like Furniture but as soon as you go close or do something it changes it was deceptive stuff. It looks normal. But as soon as you did something that changed and became like yeah harmful something scary pop out or something, but there was that was just one of the dreams I have other dreams 2 and when she wasn't there.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you remember those?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah. I was just I had the ability to fly. It was weird, but look like Google Maps. Do you do that? Sometimes? I just sometimes just caught myself down on some corner of the street and the images via where you can actually see the street level View and then you just go from one point to one point and then you're able to see the whole street like that. So it was like that. Yeah. I was just imagining I would say, okay. I'm going to go down the street and I would just fly over it. I don't know. I was in an auto just really famous actor in India. He doesn't look so good now he's in his forties, but I was with him and he was 18 and he looks really really cute and hot it's weird. And then I tried really really hard to imagine Victor straight, but I just couldn't do it for some reason then finally did it I cheated or something and I did it and that was hovering over him or something. That's it. It's so weird.\n",
            "Doctor: What was the feeling in the dream?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I was just like om flying. I don't know that I was serving stuff. I don't know. I can't describe it.\n",
            "Doctor: What was your relationship with the actor?\n",
            "Patient: I think it was sexual. It's very weird and rare for me to have that kind of dream. But yeah, he was holding me in his arms or something. Isn't that weird after I had that dream? I I don't know. I think I had that dream after the walking into the deceptive living room with David.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you make of it?\n",
            "Patient: I'm crazy. No, maybe not that.\n",
            "Doctor: That's interesting.\n",
            "Patient: No, I mean, I'm sure you've heard crazier dreams in your profession. But no, I mean I need David through his guidance. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's what comes to mind.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: knitting David\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and for the first time maybe letting him be letting him take care of me letting him leave me. I don't know what I feel about that because I thought I would want to do it myself take care of stuff myself, I think because I said it in this way before that. I feel like everyone is expecting me to be an adult and be independent and I feel that myself. So maybe I was resisting him being in charge and leaning on but I guess I'm accepting that I should lean on him more or I all ready and waiting on him. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, it sounds like the dream with a sort of sexual relationship with that actor came after.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know why it was totally unexpected because I was just having a very innocent dream about flying.\n",
            "Doctor: So the flying came first?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think I might have seen my mom. Also, she was teaching or something in the school and I just started flying from there.\n",
            "Doctor: What did it feel like?\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: The fly, what did it feel like?\n",
            "Patient: Ritz carry a bit weird but normal an exciting imaginative and also I guess a little yeah fun and dangerous and being Sly and because I kept telling myself course, I'm invisible. No one can see me so\n",
            "Doctor: So you were flying and you were invisible or you were just high up?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It's like the Google Maps thing you feel it's yet. It was pretty close because of the ground buildings. I don't know but then hang with the actor I was visible.\n",
            "Doctor: You were visible.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you feel free?\n",
            "Patient: I guess I felt just like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed you or I was doing something that people I don't know might find weird if they knew about it or not like it or something like that. But yeah, it was springing. I don't exactly know what it feels like to feel free. There's a lot of anxiety attached to freedom I think for me so because I'm doing something it feels like I'm doing it for the first time or I don't know what it's going to be. Yeah. What is free? What is it? What do you mean when you say feel free? I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: This was this is a very Cecilia piece thing to say you startle operating on it. You have an idea and then you stop and then you ask me.\n",
            "Patient: No, because I'm saying I'm telling that for me. It's something that's full of anxiety. So I'm not really sure that is freedom or if it's not.\n",
            "Doctor: weather freedom and anxiety to go together\n",
            "Patient: I guess they do but I'm saying for me they do I haven't asked other people if that's something to them, too.\n",
            "Doctor: What you make of looking for pictures free?\n",
            "Patient: My obsession with him as David puts it. Yeah, this is so much crap attached to that whole thing. It's just so weird. Yeah, the best everyone is doing or just ignoring it and nothing can matter again. Yeah, I don't think about it. Now I was asking about like will we ever be okay with him or I don't know. I mean, he was a good friend and now he's not even that. Yeah, there's so much weirdness that episode I see him on Facebook or David says stalk him or I don't know any spending women and it's like I don't know. I'm just afraid I mean I wanted to give me that he's seeing other women, but I'm not sure if I am. Okay. I think I have it was hovering over his bed because he was sleeping and I just wanted to be like give him a hug and then just quickly fly away or something. It wasn't a sexual thing which is weird because it should be but it wasn't it was actually sexual with a third totally different unattainable guy. It's like unattainable in every single way. I mean you look that way in 86 or 90 or something. but\n",
            "Doctor: So there was a confusion of time in the dream, too.\n",
            "Patient: No, no, no. Oh, yeah, maybe you're right. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: In that piece anyway.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well yeah, I'm not sure what time it was I just assumed that what that meant was like it still But this guy this actor still looks like what he did when I actually just have a crush on him as a 10 year old or something. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think that's the relationship with Victor to that this sort of kind of love like comfort thing you're feeling. That this sort of kind of love like comfort thing you're looking for. It feels like a younger your younger self to.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I guess love makes you feel younger.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I was coming on the non-sexual piece. I was thinking you were struck by the fact that it didn't feel like a sexual relationship almost like a friend or even the parents like just that comfort.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm so you associate it to be 10 when the actor was age. He was so I wondering if you and the dream. We're sort of a younger person looking for something Comfort or love.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know if I was younger. Maybe I was a little younger. I don't know. I never pay attention to my age in my dreams. I don't know if other people do but yeah, I come across I never thought about it, but I think I come across as a girl child not really a woman, but that's because I don't think of myself as a woman. I don't know when I will but I was stopping my arms and my arms look pretty thin. So I was like, yeah, this could be a younger me or yeah, maybe I feel like that because I just don't have friends were younger to me. So I don't feel older. I did a twenty-four-year-old a while ago. I didn't know he was going for I thought he was in his thirties. But as soon as he told me he was 20 or I just completely lost interest if I even had in the first place, but I didn't really feel old with him. We didn't really do anything sexual so Yeah, it's just like I don't know with Victor. I just feel like there's so much the Press stuff now is just going to be surprised. I wanted to get to give him this book for his birthday, but I couldn't even bring myself to mailing it or telling him that I bought it. So. That's keeps telling me he treated you really really badly. And he even said yesterday. Are you going to ruin your career your dreams just because of him you're so you're obsessed with him, and I was like God, I hope not so\n",
            "Doctor: How would that happen that you would ruin your dreams?\n",
            "Patient: Just not being able to work and I'm just constantly thinking about him and stuff. I guess I'm trying that's what I'm trying not to do. I don't but I do think about him but it's I don't try to con because then I'll just be like, oh has he replied or if I might want to see him then I'd be like, oh does he want to see me and when and in what condition and if I see him then I'll be like, oh are we going to get back together or not? And it's just going to be it's going to waste too much time. So weeks months. I don't really have that shouldn't do that right now to stage.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you think the explosives represented?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. Well now that I'm describing the dream. I was struck by the hold deceptive aspect of the things they look normal and then that's how I feel like stuck. Process, you know, oh I can deal with the situation and but then explodes in my face or scares me. It was scarier than explosives. It was more like I don't know it might change into a ghost or Witcher something and\n",
            "Doctor: Things are not what they seem.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and then I was like a damn. I don't know maybe in a haunted house or something or not really because everything was right and stuff, but then you go up close and then just kind of changed and I didn't know how to deal with it where David was dealing with them. So yeah, I mean in some ways I guess I felt like that maybe if I go to parties with him host by his friends or his faculty and just watching and waiting for a cue for him from where ya where in India is when he was doing his research. I was just following him and being with him made it easier or navigating form City even know how to navigate the city take an ottoman stuff even in my own University. I was with him and he and I were traveling together. So yeah, I mean in a place like idiots a bit risky for a single woman to go about on her own. I mean they do it all the time, but it just like I haven't been there in a long time so it for me it's a bit scary. So it's nice that he was there with me. Yeah, but how can I feel secure if I've had him it if I'm a sidekick? Well, it's funny isn't it funny is ironic because he's there to make you feel secure, but then I feel insecure because I'm not secure on myself. Batman or not? I'm robbing, but I'm not even like I don't even have half the powers that Robin might have I don't even know what powers does Robin have butt.\n",
            "Doctor: You see it, but you can't shine.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess because then I was flying on my own and I see what you mean about it being liberating. It was I mean it was all so it was a twinge of anxiety with it. Not that oh my God, I'm going to fall. I don't think I felt that but I just do I know what I'm doing that kind of thing.\n",
            "Doctor: So there's an anxiety about having a freedom.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, it's just like what I said so often hear that okay. I have 45 minutes. What? I say how do I say it?\n",
            "Doctor: What do you do with open space?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and yeah, it was in an urban space. I was I had my roots like I said on it was like Google Maps. It was really from point A to point B, actually remember thinking that okay from now. I'm going to fly from the street and straight to that to the end of buck Street, which is where Victor's house is or something like that is very structured and oriented. It was not open space and on top of an ocean or something. Yeah, I wish I knew how to feel more secure just by myself. It's okay. If David wants to help me in he wants to take care of me and I should let him but I should also know I can figure out that just have to furniture on my own.\n",
            "Doctor: You know the feeling we're going to need to stop for today. So I will see you next Wednesday and next Friday.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, sounds good.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, and that will give us one.\n",
            "Patient: Merry Christmas\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, thank you very much. Same to you. Take care.\n",
            "Patient: U2\n",
            "Doctor: Bye.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Let's see. I got a call from dr. Vaughn.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Yesterday like right after noon and I'll call her back today. I think she just wanted sort of\n",
            "Patient: I think she wanted to know for about it.\n",
            "Doctor: more information about what's going on.\n",
            "Patient: I sent her a kind of pretty detailed outline of what happened to me. It was pretty hard. I'm assuming it was okay for her to call you.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay with me.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Of course.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so for but I like long-term Subs like she's doing in the spring and apply for anything yesterday or yesterday because the sense of Doom was a little bit too overpowering when I'm sure that I think it's a job that if I do get the job. I'm going to fail at it. I'm usually not I'm not usually the best time for me to fill out the application. Yeah, I think I'm getting on James's nurse. I don't know. I think he expects or wants me to or thinks I have kind of control over this that I sort of think I should have also. I don't know what I think he has now. I think I have to have but I don't think that I am not sure that I do. Yeah. Then I feel like a prisoner in my life. But then second guess all of this. You know, how much is how much of it is? I don't actually want to die and I'm in so I'm looking for an excuse to stick around.\n",
            "Doctor: You lost me there a little bit. I know what you meant. I'm not sure how it connects.\n",
            "Patient: So it's just that I don't know how much of my Resentment against James for being the person who he wants me to be here is real. Does that help at all? You know that I don't hurt myself because James doesn't want me to because I feel like I have responsibilities towards him, but I don't know how much of that is real and how much of that I'm really actually\n",
            "Doctor: You're using him as a standing.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, it doesn't matter but\n",
            "Doctor: Right, but I guess you'd want to know how much your kind of putting your desire to not hurt yourself and to be alive and to him and how much it's just not there.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like such a coward like different but I can't do anything. I'm not doing anything to make it different, you know, and then I wonder how much of that is me in just not wanting to feel like I'm totally out of control a lot of navigating. A lot of navigating in the last day or not actually more than you not actually more than usual a lot of if I make it.\n",
            "Doctor: What sounds like you're pretty mad at James are pretty resentful of him and we don't know if just like what you said before if that's cuz of what he wants or what you want what you're giving him to want whatever for the moment.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I'm pretty resentful of him.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and I guess the idea is that if it weren't for him damn it, you could just be dead. And I would get you out of this. You would stop being a prisoner in your own life and you'd be done suffering.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess that's what it feels like whatever the hell else is going on.\n",
            "Patient: Yes. Yes. Yeah, I can't just accept that it that's how it feels. I have to second-guess it but that is how it feels.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I guess another aspect of it is that he's really betraying you like your loyalty eating you alive and his disloyalty to what really matters the most to you, which might be being dead is also keeping you alive.\n",
            "Patient: Haven't thought about it in those terms. It's funny. I'm not angry at you, which I find interested. Also interesting that one of the reasons. I'm not angry at you is because I don't think you care all that much and it's kind of a stance that I needed to get it to release. honestly, and I they don't feel like you are personally invested in me that the way James is personally invested in me or like the other people that take care of me, you know, maybe I just need to have somebody that I'm not not angry at pretty angry at myself pretty angry at the most people in my life.\n",
            "Doctor: I had the impression that there's something dangerous about the possibility that I do care about what happens to you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm not sure what or why.\n",
            "Doctor: Meet at the moment, but one thing it makes me think that is I'm pretty sure with some of the including house kind of both of you in a way over looking what you feel like you want the most. I think that probably felt like me taking your side a little bit or at least seeing your side.\n",
            "Patient: seamless\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, seeing your side.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, you're pretty careful not to take a side.\n",
            "Doctor: And I guess it seems to me relevant is that when I was seeing your side you had to remind both of us that I don't really care. What happens to you.\n",
            "Patient: No, I was just thinking about that last night and I was thinking about being angry and was kind of thinking about not being angry with you and trying to find out why that was. So maybe but it feels like it was more like a natural correction.\n",
            "Doctor: Probably it'll be harder to talk to me if I care what would happen.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it would be much harder. I feel like I am like both James and I are blackmailing one another with caring about each other. I feel like sometimes I'm coercing him into you know, bending over backwards to take care of me and I feel like he's somehow coercing me into sticking around.\n",
            "Doctor: Imagine you feel like this is pretty cool. For both of you that way.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, James is very upset and he doesn't feel like he's allowed to be upset because it upsets me so much and to some extent. No, he's not. It does not it does upset me too much unless it's not a tenable position for us to be in. I feel like I am working just as hard as he is. I'm working that in that state has his way rather than an in an active heart of Deceit, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, that's right.\n",
            "Patient: Fruits of my work are I am still here or I'm dirt hindering or whatever and I'm a little resentful of the fact that it's hard to see that's that that's really hard.\n",
            "Doctor: And you been somewhat functional which I think is also a lot of effort and work and not hurting or killing yourself, but still it's a lot of work.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, go into work. Not in the last World is but before that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and he's forcing that on you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah and a part of me really just wants him to say it's okay do what you need to do. But like he's not going to going to say that. Northshore tea, but that's not really the most important thought in my head.\n",
            "Doctor: Where you want him say that so you can just end it.\n",
            "Patient: Or even assured or that not going to work. Been riding a lot and I don't know to some extent it seems helpful and to some extent it seems like it gets me worked up. Which again makes me feel like maybe I ought to have control over it and don't or maybe I do have control over it and I'm just choosing to be like this.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you really have it in for yourself, huh?\n",
            "Patient: I do. Yeah, James last night and one of those things he said was he doesn't feel like I should be able to be filled. Where is that? I don't feel or not feel the way. I feel like he doesn't understand why I don't cry why I don't get upset when I get upset. But it's like I can't except when I have to and then it's really really bad. Memories We have\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know you seem angry or to me than you seem sad at the moment not so I don't imagine you're feeling both.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, right now I'm a little more Angry, you know, it's early in the morning. So I'm not feeling that much of anything. I'm so angry with myself. I keep thinking like what is this anger doing for me not getting very far with that.\n",
            "Doctor: Let's back up a little bit. What are the angry thoughts?\n",
            "Patient: Could I should be able to see a way out of this but I should be able to to do something more active. I don't know what I'm doing. I should be able to to just cope and go to work and I should be able to kill myself or I should be able to find some other option. I feel like my existence is hurting people I love but that if I left I would hurt them more. I feel like I'm not good for much. I'm not like I don't have anything to offer.\n",
            "Doctor: I feel like your choices are between leaving people. You care about quite upset and unhappy and how you're feeling or killing yourself and making them even more and that if you had any use at all and you'd be able to figure out a way out of this or would make it better, but you can't do that either. So this is like another job in a way that your\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, what I really want to do is just sit around and read books, you know, and sometimes when I'm going to bed or I can kind of snap into a mindset from where I can change things and I can make a change in my life and feel okay about where I am when I feel really bad and I just can't get there. I can't remember any of the things that used to be comforting.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it seems like the times you felt the worst when there is something you feel you should be able to handle that. You just can't like attack.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Like with the apartment and showing the apartment or stopping school or work like Starbucks?\n",
            "Patient: That's about right. There are things that it's important to other people that I be able to do. So there's a reason I should be able to do them. And I just can't I can't but then I wonder is it just is it just that I'm not organized enough for that? I'm not willing to hurt enough. Maybe I could\n",
            "Doctor: Or maybe there's a moment you start to listen to yourself and take how much you're hurting more seriously.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like I did that all if I did that all the time I never be able to do anything. I was cleared to work a month ago.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think what I said just probably made you feel worse.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I was already thinking that turn up. So it feels like with things like work, it feels like I say to people okay, this is hard. This is getting pretty hard. Maybe this is too hard for me and they say no you have to do it and I say, okay, I'll try to do it but this is I don't think I can do this. This is too hard and I just mean while you know continue to do it and they say no there's a choice you have to do it and but eventually I just drop everything you say. No really like I'm going to die. I can't do this and they say why didn't you say so It's not like I don't complain. Don't I don't know how to hit the right note to let people know that. I'm really serious that it's\n",
            "Doctor: You really can't do it.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's really just too much.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe that's because I do do it well to the point where I just can't do it anymore at all. So why couldn't I just do it a little less well.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you say you're done with Starbucks and go what you're saying?\n",
            "Patient: It's a part of it. I need to be done. I don't I don't know what's going to happen. I don't like it. But you know, maybe I don't absolutely absolutely need to be done. But I need to be done enough that maybe she's not to fuck around with. And you know, I'll probably give two weeks notice because that seems like the fair thing to do think maybe say I can work up until Christmas Eve, you know, I was going to have a week off after there anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: Cuz I feel like something you can do.\n",
            "Patient: I didn't know it just feels like something I have to do. So, you know, I feel like I can work the rest of this week because I am only working two days this week. Yeah, I don't know so much of what I do. I think I can't do until I do it. So I think probably yes. I can probably do it. I just feel so bad. I just got a job. I don't know. What's wrong.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, if because of what it means to you, you know, it's not about physically making coffee and running around for 8 hours difficult as those things can be as I understand.\n",
            "Patient: Running around for 8 hours. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But that's not why you can't go back there. It's because of what it means. I think you have to be forcing yourself to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah hard to believe it's hard to have to feel like by everyday. It's hard to police myself that for 8 hours.\n",
            "Doctor: I thought I wonder how much you are. Also feeling really worried about whether you're going to be able to do this therapy.\n",
            "Patient: It's partly that.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean this was triggered by stuff we talked about on Friday, which is just what the doctor made you so scared about.\n",
            "Patient: That thought had crossed my mind.\n",
            "Doctor: I do not doubt that it did.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And this really is the main thing you're doing these days probably in an addition to like keeping yourself alive and keeping yourself married.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I know like for a moment, it feels like a Lifeline but I imagine you're also really scared. You're going to lose it. But things are going to get stirred up that you were going to make that are going to make it impossible or too overwhelming for you to do or maybe that I don't think so. I'm not sure if I'll think so you'll think so or what but\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, I worried that I'll need to be hospitalized again. In other ways like I can but it's just a holding pattern and I don't know who my would be would pretty much be. I don't know who would run into. I don't know who would run into, you know, like if I had to be hospitalized this weekend, it would be a lot harder for me to say, you know, I think we're doing the right thing. Yeah, and I worried I won't be able to handle that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think that I hope it's very clear that I'm not in any way making a case about what you should do, but I'm out of Starbucks maybe taking some of the heat from therapy here.\n",
            "Patient: How do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Like Starbucks May well be impossible in some way again. I'm not striving to say otherwise, but I wonder if you're turning a little bit from what from really worrying about being able to do this to that. He definitely can't do that. You may not be able to do that entirely independent of this. I don't.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it feels like Starbucks and this are conflicting in some ways. I can things that make me go to my job. They're the things that make me shut down here or to upset to deal with anything. I feel like this is more important.\n",
            "Doctor: I think another thing that makes a scary is an addition to the lifeline aspect of this I suspect you I'm pretty sure that you have done something one of them very interesting that you have done here Sebastian hope which is in pretty short supply and I make the prospect of not being able to do this I think all the scarier\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I pretty much don't entertain it because it's painful would be impossible without it. So then it seems like an impossible to do. I don't know what to do other than this.\n",
            "Doctor: River\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I kind of keep saying to myself. This is the shortcut.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Just got to keep working.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, well, we should stop being in touch with and yeah, I'll get back in touch with dr. Vaughn.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: And how are you doing today?\n",
            "Patient: I'm okay had a last Tuesday had a breakdown at work or I was fine in the morning. I was fine for most of the afternoon and then towards the end of the last like our that I was working. I started like shaking. And then I realized that I was panicking I was able to hide this from everybody but ended up, you know, leaving an hour early, which I mean isn't that abnormal for me especially because right now hurts my hands. But I ended up going to my parents place first because I didn't know that I would be able to make it. All the way back to Sydney, you know New Haven and so I ended up calling. Dr. Barnes decided like she called me back and so he put me back on the Seroquel.\n",
            "Doctor: That's unusual for you to panic at work.\n",
            "Patient: I know that's when I realized it was like it wasn't just the apartment or something because I don't normally Panic at work.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, that's different.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So do you notice a difference already and being back on the Seroquel? Is it just Tuesday like yesterday Tuesday or a week ago Tuesday?\n",
            "Patient: a week ago Tuesday\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: So I've been on for a week. I mean, I think it helps them. I was Panic free for a few days and then the past couple of days. I've been so like sad again and suicidal again, but\n",
            "Doctor: That's pretty significant.\n",
            "Patient: I've been suicidal all along like for the past few weeks, but not as suicidal as I was when I was not on the Seroquel. I think it's helping.\n",
            "Doctor: The past few days what when you say suicidal, what does that really mean? How long have the thoughts been what level have the thoughts been?\n",
            "Patient: What's more like I was kind of really sad but usually like not that long but they weren't just like instant and go away. They were like maybe 5 minutes or so.\n",
            "Doctor: That's a really uncomfortable 5 minutes. It can feel like a really long time when you're feeling that sat.\n",
            "Patient: This morning. I just sort of realized that because it was my birthday. And Sydney was we stayed up late the night before like we are going to go out and do this and then he like couldn't go to sleep and like, you know, you didn't bother taking an Ambien or you know NyQuil or what was my birthday. So then he was like sleeping in and don't even like I didn't get up until 10:30 and he didn't get up until like 11. I guess it's not that late but\n",
            "Doctor: You felt disappointed clearly.\n",
            "Patient: Because I'm not seeing any friends because I don't have a place to host them. Like I don't my Apartments too small. I can't ever have a party and I haven't done things with friends in like forever and it made me really sad and I feel like I have no friends because Sydney is like why don't you just have a couple over and I'm like if I did the couple that I'd want to have when you Lucy in Walter, but they're you know, they move to Florida like a year-and-a-half ago now.\n",
            "Doctor: And you miss them.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I just don't feel like I have any close friends anymore and I just couldn't think of any way then he was like, oh, well, you know where she was like trying to help but then I shot down his idea and then he got mad at me and he was like, okay I quit and I'm like thanks. I just feel so hopeless and I was considering like I didn't go into work yesterday either because I was sick on Monday. And yesterday I like Monday night. I was feeling really suicidal and bad depressed and I guess it wasn't me. I wasn't even suicidal. It was like the physical feeling of uncomfortableness and tightness from anxiety. That's what I was feeling.\n",
            "Doctor: That's what I was feeling. So there was no thought at that point.\n",
            "Patient: There might have been there was possibly a thought about like I should kill myself to end this feeling and the feeling wouldn't go away. I mean yesterday there was snow anyways, but I'm like this close to finishing my job and like considering quitting right before the end when like accept that was you leave on bad terms, but I just don't know that I could keep it together enough and if I keep on feeling like this like that tightness just wasn't going away.\n",
            "Doctor: So that tightness is really uncomfortable.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like I can sort of put it away. Like if we were doing like something distracting like watching an episode of something or like listening to a podcast. But as soon as like the episode of podcast or whatever end it comes back.\n",
            "Doctor: And doesn't go away at work or it didn't on that last Tuesday.\n",
            "Patient: Well, it wasn't the tightness. It was like last Tuesday. It was shaking. I don't remember there being that tightness at work. Maybe there was I'm just so uncomfortable and I have no way of like going like making it go away permanently. It just seems hopeless and I just like, okay these drugs aren't stopping that feeling.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you feeling not tightness now?\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: It doesn't feel like you have any control over it, but it does go away.\n",
            "Patient: It does go away. But I feel like I have no control over it. It's happening if it happens more and more and like it the Seroquel isn't going to help either then like I mean, I guess I it's helping some but it's not helping enough and like I can't you know, I don't know if the imipramine has stopped working or something and I can't really go back on the Wellbutrin because it's really bad for anxiety, and I'm just like I've run out of options.\n",
            "Doctor: Let's give the Seroquel some more time to work. He's been on it for a week. It sounds like it's helping a little let's see what happen. How is things like I know it's been snowing. Have you been able to exercise at all?\n",
            "Patient: No, I haven't.\n",
            "Doctor: Because that's sometimes you know, when that's more available to you that can really help because the tightness is muscles, right? That's a muscle tightening that you're feeling. It's really uncomfortable. It's not dangerous, but it's really comfortable and not something that exercise can really help with.\n",
            "Patient: But how am I supposed to like usually happens at night?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's not necessarily that is just something that helps in the moment. But when you're more active that can lower the bass line the way to discharge some of this energy that's right. Now being translated into anxiety and tension and all of the good Healthcare self-care things that you do like getting regular sleep exercising on a regular basis. They lower the bass line anxiety. So it's not something. Yes, it can help in the moment. If you're starting to feel really anxious and it's a time when you can get out and exercise it can add that destruction the phone in a moment, but if you're able to get engaged in a little bit of activity every day that helps all the time just to lower the overall anxiety the discharge some of that energy to get endorphins flowing that counteracts some of this other stuff you're feeling the exercise can be a mood lift and an anxiety prevention technique that works across X on something that's really hard for you to access so it's not working for you.\n",
            "Patient: It's so Snowy out.\n",
            "Doctor: It's been a rough winter.\n",
            "Patient: Like I have to wait for it to stop being snowy like I'm okay with walking in the cold but like not really walking like in the snow and like right now it's just so slippery out like even getting to the car to get here was like a challenge.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's definitely more challenging. It's been a rough winter for them.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like I probably can't wait until the end of winter to like start exercising but I don't really have any other choices, like maybe I'll get because then I could have time and then I could join a gym or something or like\n",
            "Doctor: Or go someplace indoors like even just doing laps in a mall right you think about I know we talked last time about thinking creates a creatively about how to navigate some of the challenges people do still exercise in the winter and when not be in weather going to be driving someplace and doing laps in a mall or finding it's their path you get creative if you can find ways to overcome some of the challenges so that you don't have to put doing something good for yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Like lots of running or lots of walking.\n",
            "Doctor: walking\n",
            "Patient: Okay, because running in the mall.\n",
            "Doctor: You can walk laps around any indoor space.\n",
            "Patient: I think the winter is driving me crazy. Just hearing like, you know, when I find out there's going to be more snow is just makes me so sad and\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I can't deal with winter anymore. But there's really nothing. I you know.\n",
            "Doctor: That one's out of your control. We can find ways to try to make the best of it. But absolutely we can't control the weather.\n",
            "Patient: I mean unless I went on a trip somewhere.\n",
            "Doctor: That is the way to escape in.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I need to finish up my job. And by the time I finish hopefully winter won't be as bad anymore. I want to be able to go on walks and stuff. Yeah, I don't really foresee myself having time to do it for the next few days.\n",
            "Doctor: What are the next few days look like?\n",
            "Patient: Well tomorrow I have work.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're going to go.\n",
            "Patient: And I'm going to go to work and get as much done as I can to try to finish up this. early It's right to finish this up early. Then I Friday morning. I have my actual appointment with dr. Barnes. They're going down to Rhode Island, and I actually need to help cook because my mom has them.\n",
            "Doctor: What's going on with your mom?\n",
            "Patient: Did I tell you that like my parents have been fostering cats with kittens? So the new foster mom, her name is Kelly and she's she gave birth to kittens a week ago today or a week ago yesterday and like a right before she was giving birth like she started acting like really crazy like, you know, like she had been really nice and letting people pet her like acting crazy. Like if you stop petting her she'll attack you and now it's a baby's if you get too close to the babies are look at the baby's still attack you and she actually move them like she had them in the playpen area. That she liked took the kittens out and move them to like underneath the Hope Chest that had been like fenced-off where they weren't supposed to be going. But I mean, it's a safe place for now. But like I think sometimes she's been less crazy. But like she managed to bite into my mother Mom's hand the point like it got swollen and like she had to go to the doctor and they gave her medicine which wasn't like instead of like it hadn't done enough yet and rather than wait and see if the medicine would work. They want to give her the option of either going to the hospital or getting an IV that you can have at home. And so she has the ivy until Saturday.\n",
            "Doctor: Wow.\n",
            "Patient: Do I need to help her cook, so not really a chance for a walk.\n",
            "Doctor: Well one way to do it is to think about I know a long way back. We thought about instead of thinking about doing that concentrated exercise just how to build a little more movement or activity and today so it sounds like you're going to be, you know, like parking at work parking at the doctor's office.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Park a little bit further away\n",
            "Patient: Work I can't really do that because it's just like there is the parking garage and then I have the past 2 and that's my free parking.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so choose a spot. That's the longest walk.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: And then it's just you know, so you get a couple of minutes. Maybe they're the same thing at the doctor's office. It's supposed to be warmer on Friday, you know a safe spot but a little bit further away don't pick the one that's closest to the door take the one that's safe, but farthest away from the door and give yourself an extra couple of nasty spot and that can build in, you know, just 10 minutes of walking during the day just by doing a couple of things like that and that's Amanda manager away, you know to be able to walk in places that probably have been plowed, you know, they're going to pop a parking lot. The parking garage is covered.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And gives you just a few minutes of being a little bit more active maybe a little bit of fresh air here and there that's a way you can be more in control of what you're able to do.\n",
            "Patient: I think I can do that.\n",
            "Doctor: That sounds manageable.\n",
            "Patient: It just doesn't sound like it's going to be enough.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not forever, but it's what you can fit in these couple of days. So instead of seeing all the options that are close to you is option that you can take these couple of days.\n",
            "Patient: I want to go on walks. I really do just driving through the snow with my snow boots and things being slippery. I hate it so much.\n",
            "Doctor: I know.\n",
            "Patient: But I really should at least be taking the stairs instead of the elevator at my place.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you been doing that?\n",
            "Patient: I know it depends sometimes on the way down not usually on the way up, especially if I'm like carrying heavy stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you choose year, did you use elevator or the stairs here?\n",
            "Patient: Depends on the day but usually the elevator on the way up and usually the stairs on the way down.\n",
            "Doctor: So what about choosing the stairs on the way up to is that something you feel like you could do?\n",
            "Patient: I guess it depends on what I have on when I had on the day that I had my backpack in my computer. Like I guess I could have I was just afraid I was going to hurt my back like carrying it up the stairs. I don't carry that much on me I could.\n",
            "Doctor: What store is your apartment?\n",
            "Patient: It's on the it's on the third floor, but the ground floor has one. So it's two two flights up.\n",
            "Doctor: So those are ways to look for a little bit more. Maybe on days when you're not carrying as heavy of a load. She was in the stairs up on the way to the stairs off as well as choosing the stairs down our little ways for you to take control of where you can get in just a little bit more movement in your day. I think one of the things that work when looking for is not how to make huge changes but places where you can feel less crap because I think that feeling that's hiding in your chest and that I want to escape sometimes that translates to like I should kill myself to stop this. Those are it seems to me that those all come from feeling like you don't have any choices and that you're trapped and you know, that can be from you know, all these snow storms feel like they're kind of trapping the small apartment feels like a strapping, you know, not knowing what your job options are going to be kind of news you feeling trapped financially. So the more places we can look for like well, what are what are little choices that you can make maybe you can't change the whole situation but there might be some changes you can make with in so it doesn't feel like so much like you're backed into a corner without any options whatsoever. Sounds like that's kind of what kind of happened with your birthday to you. Can't you don't have a space where you feel like you can invite everybody over for a party. So it felt like you had no option and was going to try to give you a suggestion. It didn't feel good.\n",
            "Patient: No, it really didn't. I mean she was like, oh we can take because we still have some boxes like my parents came up over the weekend and help but I still have some boxes and don't really have a place to put them it would have been too hard to move everything out in time.\n",
            "Doctor: So if you got creative what could be a choice that you can make that doesn't feel like a choice having people over but is there something else you could do maybe to celebrate belatedly on another day?\n",
            "Patient: Probably yes go out to a restaurant or maybe if someone else really tells me I don't know it's not like any of my friends suggested getting together.\n",
            "Doctor: Would you like to invite somebody to a restaurant?\n",
            "Patient: Maybe it's just that I'm sort of I feel a little bit uncomfortable with that because then it's like, you know suggesting an activity that people have to spend money on. I mean which I guess is okay and also like pending weather or they eat kosher and that's going to be an issue. I guess most of my friends don't possibly all of my friends they can of at least like Dairy food out in a restaurant or non-kosher restaurant.\n",
            "Doctor: That may be a way to acknowledge your birthday. And if you frame it, you know as like, you know, would you like to come have go out to the dinner together? So it doesn't imply that you're hosting a whole thing, but people can go out to dinner and each pay and that's a way for you to know that your birthday.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I feel like I've lost touch with all my friends because I have who would you like to reach out to?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure.\n",
            "Doctor: It seems like it's important to connect again with them.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know maybe like Phillip and Amy, maybe like I haven't actually gone and rejoined yet. And it feels weird that if I were doing it, like you know right after I got like if I'm going to make Sunday my first rehearsal like being like hey, let's all get dinner like right before the rehearsal so that people that like, I mean, I know most of the people in the group right now, I think they only have like three new members but still a little bit weird suggesting it when I haven't actually rejoined the group yet because like the following weekend, I won't actually be able to come to rehearsal. So I'm like do I want to start when I can't make all the hurdles yet, which is still in a way because I actually like that like even if I'm only going to have rehearsals for now, that's still more rehearsal then if I wait to get back,\n",
            "Doctor: That's true.\n",
            "Patient: So also just afraid of the time commitment and stuff. But if I'm going to be unemployed again, it's not going to be that bad and if I can get a reasonable job at like is around here, you know, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Will it be time that you know, enjoy?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Actually in that now that more hours anymore. I think there isn't any you know, all the drama is gone like all the dramatic people finally left.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so it might feel good to get together with the group and might feel good to sing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm just afraid I don't want to be like a and stuff and like I'll have to miss like next weekend. I have an event and then like there are two weeks that I'm house-sitting for my parents will there in Israel?\n",
            "Doctor: Those are things that are all set up before you decided to rejoin.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean if it seems like if you're up front with the leaders that you know, you got these commitments already, but you'd like to rejoin.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Talk with them instead of shutting yourself out of something talk to them about it.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, she'll probably call the my doctor.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean there are two things going on socially. When is that use you no feel sad to you that you haven't planned something to acknowledge your birthday. It's a very noticeable moment of having disconnected from your friend. So maybe that's not you know something that you involve the people in but you've also noticed that you've really disconnected from your friends and you've missed being part of a group and music piece fits that so maybe reaching out to fill up. Annie me about getting together for dinner and knowledge in your birthday that works on one piece and talking to the music people about whether it would make sense to start now and sort of piecemeal of what because of these other commitments this evening. If you can reconnect with that group and enjoyed getting back in touch with that part of yourself,\n",
            "Patient: I guess I can do that. It's scary.\n",
            "Doctor: What are you up to?\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'm afraid with music that the time commitment is due and not being able to make rehearsals are feeling trapped at I have to go to rehearsal and I'm like really sad or something.\n",
            "Doctor: What would be the worst case scenario?\n",
            "Patient: I missed rehearsal and end up staying on the wall and crying and feeling a tightness and not having it go away. I guess if I missed too many of rehearsals and getting kicked out that probably would happen.\n",
            "Doctor: It's never happened in the past.\n",
            "Patient: I've also never been this depressed and trying to be in an acapella group at the same time in the past. I've missed very few rehearsals for emotional reasons. I think there was like, you know a couple of a bunch that I missed when I was like dealing with Jonas and when oh, I didn't even miss that rehearsal the one wouldn't I like Corey and the day before I found out that he didn't like me back and I was like, oh God, I have to face him at rehearsal. I'm just going to play video games instead and then I ended up maybe being like 30 minutes late to rehearsal but still went\n",
            "Doctor: Sometimes I think you're more resilient than you give yourself credit for.\n",
            "Patient: I haven't been this depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: What if it helps?\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I guess it could but it could also hurt and I don't know which it'll be.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, if it hurts then you stopped this is not signing up for lifetime membership. If it turns out that it's harmful in some way than you stop if it's useful if you enjoy it. That's probably a good thing. If you reconnect with some people you enjoy those things tend to be good at treating depression, you know, getting involved with activities that are pleasurable that's good stuff and it might be that and if it feels like it's too much of a pressure right now you say, you know, I'm sorry. I realize it's too much of a time commitment right now and give yourself permission, please.\n",
            "Patient: I don't want to do that like because people have done that in the past and I don't want to be one of those people. Who does that?\n",
            "Doctor: Hopefully it won't come to that. But if that's the case, then you've learned something and sometimes people need to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But that might not be the case. It might be that it feels good to have something to go to an option. That's better than staying in a ball.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's true.\n",
            "Doctor: Or that you know that it might be hard to leave the house sometimes but when you do it might be good you get over that hurdle.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's also like freaking out on his nights like being able to get dinner before rehearsal and stuff. Especially, you know, now that I don't have anyone making me dinner anymore being able to do that all myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I mean to be responsible for that for yourself.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'm also afraid that like, you know now I'm starting to feel like older than all the people in the group and if that's going to be an issue right now if I come back I wouldn't be the oldest member of the group.\n",
            "Doctor: And how does the age become an issue?\n",
            "Patient: Well, you know, it would be a college acapella group, you know, like at a certain point like, you know, if I was like, you know 35 and people are looking very teen like you look weird Travis older person in this group. That's presumably college students or college students and grad students.\n",
            "Doctor: are they sort of upset by your age\n",
            "Patient: No, so I guess it's not an issue. Now. We actually did have someone else who is older. So he left after a year because he was involved in like a stuff. And I think it was I don't know if he's going to come back to the group. So if he came back I wouldn't be the oldest one anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like the group is not worried about it. Certainly not at your age now.\n",
            "Patient: I know sometimes we worry about like not have enough undergrads for getting funding and being classified as a certain type of Stanford group, but they don't want to kick out grad students either just more like recruiting.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, the rather than look for reasons why it might not be good now or might not be good in the future. I wonder what stops you from letting yourself kind of give it a try.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's the depression is what stops me to anxiety.\n",
            "Doctor: Your job is for you to be in control and not let the anxiety and depression being control anxiety and depression impact you but you don't have to let it control you. So I know that it those are the things that are talking right now as you think about what could go wrong or why it might not work in your life. That's being zeidan depression talking you can listen to those things, but then you make a choice that's good for you.\n",
            "Patient: It's just hard to make all the right choices because it's so easy to like, you know, just sleep in like, you know Ethan on Monday morning. I had my game like the alarm went off and we had like more time that we could sleep and I wanted to go back to sleep because I knew that if I stayed up for a certain amount of time the tightness would come back and then it did you know, and then sleep seems like the only escape from it and I can't sleep all the time.\n",
            "Doctor: No, you can't.\n",
            "Patient: But I choose lie, so I don't really know how to do anything. My whole life is falling apart.\n",
            "Doctor: You got a lot of challenges right now. So let's just focus on one piece. Like you said it's hard to make all of the right decisions would sometimes feels harder to me. So let's take it just a couple of days at a time and focus on making one or two decisions that feel like their tourist house. So, it's Wednesday evening. And you said you had some you had some plans. You're going to go to your mom's after the doctor on Friday.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What decisions do I make between now and when I see you on Monday, let's focus on just one decision that feels like it's towards house.\n",
            "Patient: I guess probably going to music rehearsal on Sunday night.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so then you set it up so that you can do that and that sort of the one step towards reaching back out to people may be getting engaged with something that would be positive. Does that feel doable or is that too big of a decision?\n",
            "Patient: Well, though just a part of me now thinks I'm making a huge mistake by wanting to join music again. I don't know if that's the depressed part of me or the sensible part of me.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it could be either let's go with if it turns out to be a bad decision. This is a decision that could be undone. Right? So when you're thinking about killing yourself to escape, that's one that can't be undone by joining music can pretty easily right. That's a smaller decision than moving out of your apartment. So it's a pretty safe one to take a gamble on.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'm so reluctant to do it now, and I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you're afraid. I'm afraid that it's going to be work rather than enjoyable.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So, let's see what it is and if it's works then you back off.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: How's the tightness now?\n",
            "Patient: It's like a little bit there.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I saw that shaky breath, which I think is maybe part of what happened. Your chest gets really tight.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like it's not as bad as it's like been the past few days.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I'm glad to hear that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: See if you can take some really deep breaths. Let the oxygen do its work.\n",
            "Patient: So what do I have the moment when I can't calm down and can't make the tightness go away.\n",
            "Doctor: Remember that the tightness is not dangerous. That's the first piece right is that is uncomfortable. That's not dangerous. I think remembering that is the first step and you might not be able to make it go away but it will go away eventually. You can try taking some deep breast. Sometimes that house. I know in the past sometimes when you try that, it feels uncomfortable to focus on the breath. So if you know, you give it a try and take some deep breaths and if that opens up your chest, you know and just like I did and just like I just did I sat back I put my shoulders back that allows you to open up your chest a little bit that can help a lot of times slowing down your breath can work to relax you a little bit like your muscles relax, if you can't get it to go away remember that it's going to go away eventually it has never lasted forever.\n",
            "Patient: true\n",
            "Doctor: It's always gone away eventually and sometimes just knowing that it's going to end and it's uncomfortable as it is. It's not harmful to you. You're safe. Can keeping those thoughts in mind can speed up the process of it going away because it's anxious worried about that. Keep you tight and anxious and worried some good describe distraction techniques. Sometimes hopping into a warm shower if you can, you know, if your home and you can do that, you can try it. If you have heating pad you try putting a heating pad on your chest to relax the area. Sometimes just a sensation of warmth or pressure can help to distract you from the other Sensations that you're feeling like you can really only feel one thing at a time either pressure or temperature. The nerve endings are the same. So sometimes if you kind of confuse your body by giving it a new temperature is there's not really notice. The pressure is much. So can this be a way I mean, you can feel both at the same time, but if you can wait it sort of distracts you So you can try some of those things but it will go away those things might hasten the process, but it's always going to go away.\n",
            "Patient: but sometimes not until I go to sleep\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, that's true.\n",
            "Patient: And then sometimes it will come back as soon as I wake up.\n",
            "Doctor: That's I know I know that's really uncomfortable.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's been so long that I can deal with that feeling it like drives me crazy half the time. I like really just want it gone any way possible.\n",
            "Doctor: So it's the only thing that will make you If you try those other things and it doesn't go away and you're at a place where you can't stand and you want sleep is a much better option than Jet and it's even a better option than worrying about it. I know that you've always told me that when you have those thoughts that you're not thinking about actually falling through and then rather than engaging in that cycle of thought for 5 minutes, if it's not night time take a nap that's better than it's better than engaging in a cycle of destructive thoughts and maybe it will be better when you wake up or maybe one of those other techniques can work and you can get some control over it and I would try this first.\n",
            "Patient: I have a heating pad. Of course, I wouldn't know where it is. I think it's one of the boxes that I haven't gone into yet.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so when it becomes available, you can try it out or have a shower or you can run some hot water over a towel put a towel in a plastic bag and lay back over your chest and it will be warm for a little bit. And you can see if the worm is soothing or run some really hot water into water bottle and do the old fashioned hot water bottle and just give yourself that warms for a little bit and see if it opens up. Those are little things you can try.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Why don't we stop there for today?\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: And I will see you Monday at our regular time.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, can I borrow a pen so I can write you a check?\n",
            "Doctor: Sir, speaking of favorite color. I have green blue purple or red.\n",
            "Patient: 00 cover purple\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Of course every time I write the day today, I'm tempted to put my birth year as the year, but it's not 1985. It is 2014.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: What's new?\n",
            "Patient: So, I don't know if I mentioned that my type of medication is changing.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, I don't think so.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, which is not really. Oh, I think I met with her like the day after we last met a day or two. I'm switching off Lexapro and onto Celexa or Celebrex whichever one is actually in a depressant.\n",
            "Doctor: Probably Celexa, I think Celexa and Lexapro, you know how there is right-handed and left-handed molecules. I think one's one and the others the other.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, she said it was kind of like unfortunately. She's like so You're going to feel like crap for a while and I was like, oh, well, then awesomely right on schedule. I started feeling like crap the 23rd 24th. Yeah. She had actually predicted that one of the worst day is probably going to be around the 27th, and it was horrible.\n",
            "Doctor: That's too bad.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah Ikea today with my parents and my mom and offered to drive me home, but we had a little miscommunication.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm going to put this on if you can talk a little louder, right she offered to drive you back.\n",
            "Patient: There was some miscommunication about me staying 3 days longer and when I realized that I was like I almost we were out at my parents house. And this all came and I'm like, I don't know if I can move her go to dinner or do anything. So I was just like, oh my God, I can't do three more days. Actually it would have been for more days at that point. Amazingly my parents. My mom did not freak out about me staying about me saying, so I'm leaving tomorrow with surprise me a lot, but she didn't\n",
            "Doctor: So what day was that?\n",
            "Patient: Thursday so what Christmas is Wednesday, so yeah the 26th. It was like\n",
            "Doctor: right, so you have the double whammy of\n",
            "Patient: yeah, I think my mom knows I wasn't feeling great. Because she was also being really anxious and one of the ways she likes to express this is just to stare at me a lot with a concerned face or speak really loudly and try to drive me into conversation, which doesn't work very well. Add appointment brother is sort of a talk to Mom. I can't do it. Yeah, I mean the trip was it was okay for the first few days or so. I was like, oh, okay Christmas to you happened Christmas happened, but That was okay, but I felt like I don't know the bed. She had me sleeping is extrude excruciating Lee and comfortable and my brother's wife gets really cold is Italy so that he doesn't like seven day and I will end it like 66 or 67. So I'm always hot and sweaty and I end up having to buy myself to shirt so I can wear something always so frustrating because there's no one no one of my house like my brother his wife my parents the largest shirt. In the house would probably be a smaller or medium so I couldn't borrow anything which always makes me feel awkward this year. My brother's like know. I have a loose shirt and I'm like, no that won't say I'm having that argument is just having the argument is just frustrating. I'm like look at the two of us I wouldn't fit and yeah, I'm still feeling I still feel like garbage. I just don't feel good, which is really frustrating. I told actually I was like, I'm really sorry. I doing this medication switch. Sorry and one day I think I think was this weekend. I was cooking something and Ashley was like, do you need any help and I was like no. No, I'm good. I was Keen to cook and then I suddenly wasn't feeling was feeling super resentful and angry at her for not helping to cook even though I hadn't asked her. In fact, in fact, I said know which made me feel so crazy because I'm just like I didn't even you know, I was both upset like I was still really upset about it, but also thinking you shouldn't be because you didn't ask what level also that was upsetting.\n",
            "Doctor: That kind of thing has been happening.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, when we were talking doctor koth at one point was asking was I was worried that I might need to take some FMLA days off. I was feeling completely extra not great. Which I don't know why last week didn't happen. I was sick on Thursday Friday. I had it I had a snow day. So I feel like I've only been working for 2 days, so I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Did dr. Bond estimate things would improve?\n",
            "Patient: We're supposed to have met on Wednesday, but he is but she's sick. So now she's saying probably a month at least.\n",
            "Doctor: Why did you switch?\n",
            "Patient: Actually wanted to switch off the Wellbutrin. Which we talked which we were talking about. But I have been. Having the sudden moments of feeling. Really intensely weepy and I don't know if they were increased but they weren't going away. So that concerned her I don't know. My response was like oh whatever. I'll tough it out. I can tough it out for a while, which is usually my response. I do agree not being super not I too agree. Not being randomly weepy would be good. If you know I could do my homework and work it would be nice. So I was talking to my mom about Wellbutrin how Wellbutrin makes me really sweaty and well and my my brother was like, oh, yeah that can happen to my mom's response was why doesn't your psychiatrist give you another drug? That's perfectly as good. That doesn't cause you to sweat. Thanks Mom. It was that easy mom. It was just so crazy like oh God. It's It was mostly funny. But I'm also like giving my mom's obsession with her how her children should be medicated. I would think that she would know more about how that might work just as well as had met major medication problems increasingly. She does not. Receive them as bad medication interactions. He took lithium and it didn't work for him. So and so my mom my mom's theory is that my brother insisted on taking Lithium because Dad took it and But he was insisting on taking it. Even though someone maybe her said that he shouldn't. My mom is I think they gave him was the end because he's bipolar and that's what everyone does but my mom kind of really blames my brother for it's very strange. I don't I've been asking her less about it about her thoughts and feelings about my brother because he's super frustrating.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I also have this I don't know what conversation with my dad that stuck with me, which was I was talking to Will. I think I was talking to Ashby. My brother's wife asked me about my frustrations at work and I felt so frustrated with chat in like not being able to get him to give me work. Even when I asked directly and she was like, why don't you ask and likewise asking but you won't give it to me and then the conversation start of stops, which I understand. They don't have an answer in my dad was in the room and he was and I was just like while you're probably not paying attention, but what do you think and he said you want me to actually answer so his response was interesting first. He mentioned that I had expressed frustrations with managers many times before which is true. He feels that I do not communicate well enough. He thinks the problem is a communication problem along with a diplomacy issue, which I really disagree. I don't think it's so I asked him to explain because I was like, I don't know. I don't think I think I know how to communicate. It's true that I can't that I can't get pissy about diplomacy, but I'm perfectly capable of doing I just don't always want to\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so first he gave me his advice which was which is to out to do Stout cat out last people which is awful. But then his other thing I guess it's called the Ben Franklin effect or the Ben Franklin method, which is Ben Franklin Ben Franklin. There was someone I guess stud at one point and Congress in Congress. You didn't get along with him Ben Franklin hated this guy because he was a jerk and so Franklin decided the way to win him over was asked a jerk for a book that Franklin really wanted to read sauce to borrow the book return the book with a note. This was such a great book. Thank you so much for doing me a favor at the favor of letting this book. It was awesome blah blah blah and then after that he want over the person. And I told him I know where this is going, but my dad the sort of idea that my dad was going with which is that if there's someone you have a conflict. But you have conflict. That you're sort of thinking about your conflict with. What you want to do is put them in a position where you think you kind of manifest some doing something a nice for you and then you compliment them. That was so great. But you were nice to me or thank you so much for your notes early on whatever and though. and through this people like being commented complemented people like something useful so\n",
            "Doctor: They like being appreciated.\n",
            "Patient: Yes and Wild. While it's like a totally interesting idea. I feel like I still don't. Feel the root of the problem is communication or my lack. Or my lack my inability to communicate which I did. I told my dad. Mike fundamentally, I can't communicate communicate around there's no way for me to communicate around bertos racism or sexism. They can't hear me in that I just so I just stopped there's nothing really to do. You didn't respond to that but we did talk a little bit about I don't know if the where is diplomacy or other things, but my dad's worked or since 1980 you worked for for like 20 years. He wasn't Academia briefly before that as a professor.\n",
            "Doctor: a chemistry professor\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and he left Academia because he disliked politics or dad. We've already talked about how we both hate the same kind of politics and doing this you would think that I would hate that. Like I don't think my dad gets the extent to which there is really no pressure for someone. His if you're not a great manager, but you're not horrible. There's no pressure to make you leave. No, one says sales are down in the music library Department. There's nothing there's no one so and there is no. So if you're if you are moderately competent enough to show it to meetings. You are just going to get this into this position and then you Be there until you retire. I'm speaking broadly, but that's what happens. That's why people like University jobs. Retirement she's working within a 4-year product environment. Where people was where someone was really confident you'd be like me hear Department efficiency, whatever whatever whatever and that just doesn't exist. I guess I felt my dad was sort of operating under the idea that this was a if the workplace is in an Ascend isn't an essentially not a guilt not a guilt but like you're not the Invisible Hand while you knock the economy, I think at his head there some kind of invisible hand of Merit.\n",
            "Doctor: I see sort you out.\n",
            "Patient: And he also I don't think really believe in what I said I've asked for work and I don't get it. He's like, well, obviously the way you've been asking for work isn't working. So you should ask another way. There's only did number of ways to do it.\n",
            "Doctor: big or small words\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I can rephrase I can try. I can you know. Whatever I've done but in the end there's a the communication problem is my fault in the end and beavers only so many ways you can ask someone for work. There are very few. I understand is completely irrational and crazy and doesn't make any sense that this would be happening but\n",
            "Doctor: that only makes it so much more stressed rating and it is\n",
            "Patient: and yeah, it's like when I talk about it people everyone's like come on. What would he say? Why would he say that there's always work for you to do and then not give you and I'm like, well, I don't know. That's a good question that I can't answer. I got very caught on.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you get lots of your mom's Wellbutrin questions, essentially, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Why don't you just do something better?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, well, there's an obvious and simple explanation for this.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you clearly haven't thought of and tried?\n",
            "Patient: I just did that. One thing that was funny is that I was talking to my dad more generally and he was like, well people probably know that you don't like your manager like well sort of I try not to express that generally people often say it to me. Oh, you must love having chat is your manager Pearl is your building head or whatever and I'm like, nope. I usually just don't answer. But if someone presses then I'll answer. My dad was like really they don't know how you feel. Okay fine, which is true. Like I'm sure than our department all staff meetings I have Kind of given up on pretending that I'm not frustrated. But all our staff meetings are actually not that many people and I don't know I guess I hope that I don't actually want to broadcast my fridge and content across the entire library. That would be bad and I'm special and also just not good. I think my dad is right that yes, certainly. Some people have noticed probably managers notice and I'm not thrilled. I mean you'd have to but the not entirely helpful response in my head is like well I try really hard to be different product. But at this point buck. Which is I sometimes think. But like if I'm capable of being diplomatic and like sucking it up or whatever and if something is critical. Better someone's Behavior shoves me over the edge and part of me is like, well you deserve it because she is Christ. The level it would have to be to try and go get to that level to have to get to me. Like vocally. I work tell someone off is pretty insane, but that's a totally fine rationalization for me, but it doesn't Carl and cheddar so in positions of power and black, you know\n",
            "Doctor: Right. I mean the only pieces that I start to wonder about and this is probably the same as everybody else. There's a partial mild aspect of did you set your dad up a little bit in the following way. In fact, you've been frustrated over thinking about struggling with this for years with Chet and have tried many different things are completely exasperated and you and you know thinking he's a terrible manager for 12 different reasons as well as and you haven't talked too much explicit explicitly about this. I mean you've alluded to it today and other times his sexism and racism which also contribute to things that make him hard to deal with that all seems like to me in a quite relevant context the question of hey, I asked my manager for work. Give me an e. What do you think I should do. Do you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know maybe that stuff your dad already knows but I guess with your dad kind of unlike your mom. I'm not surprised to hear you say your mom has a question about Wellbutrin like but the story you were telling your dad if he knew all that stuff. Maybe He suggests the Ben Franklin thing, but he wouldn't say it's just a communication problem. Maybe he would I don't know. It seems to me like there's a lot of sort of amount of time amount of effort erroneous sense of beating your head against the wall, the berries criticisms of chat that you have and which are well-earned by Chet that he doesn't know and that I imagined make his response both seem sillier and more madden mean to you.\n",
            "Patient: Sort of I have it's like he doesn't want to do an advice unless really expensive explicitly asked like really explicitly so I've asked him about dealing with racism at work and his response was by leaving them out and to try harder and that kind of thing. I was not surprised but he said I left them out. I mean kind of what I have set him up said him not exactly. I don't know I kind of said I'm up. I also kind of want them to feel like that really sucks or offer some educated perspective.\n",
            "Doctor: Don't imagine you're expecting him to have a solution for you. I imagine you wanted him to be sympathetic that like they drive you nuts and especially for somebody who a is your dad and B, you knows the workplace. He's an HR person like yeah, if you said a horrible manager can a horrible manager really can make a job miserable.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I think in the end he I think he really believes that if I had us chat in the right way that he would have been like, oh, here's whatever I talk to him about it and told him Berry is trusted details.\n",
            "Doctor: That makes sense given what you said before?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah his\n",
            "Doctor: I imagine it feels to you like kind of a fantasy. He has that if you handle it, right if you communicate right or if you sort of Strategic or understand the situation well enough that you won't run into problems like that. I imagine it feels sort of like kind of denial that he does about other things, too.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like I think the main message my dad is trying to give me about dealing with racism either in the workplace or my personal life is like no stay calm use the right nice voice don't sound like an angry black person sound like a nice person if you just freeze it right away this and stay cool and whatever the problem then the problem will go away.\n",
            "Doctor: See. Like you may be terribly vulnerable in the workplace and sometimes handling it in a certain way will help other times. It won't make a damn bit of difference.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I also think that he believes that if there if there was really a problem that HR would respond and since they have in that means there's not really a problem.\n",
            "Doctor: I see I wasn't aware. I wasn't aware. That's how it worked.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: The way that you're entirely vulnerable position with chat and you feel like people kind of want to look the other way from that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't I mean I think given what I think. It my dad does not want having done whatever activism sacrifice Exedra Exedra. He does not want well and I to be in a world where we're still suffering Rachel racial Prejudice at work or school or whatever. which sure but that's not\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: what does not but happening but he's very he's very he's very invested in that which for me I think asked the vulnerability of being in a particular work situation because I feel like I've been I've the coping skills. My dad taught me aren't actually helpful. And in some ways they can be almost self-destructive. And so I know that frustrates me a lot.\n",
            "Doctor: Where do you have his support? I mean you're saying the skills he gave you don't work and probably backfire.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think he thinks he's being supportive but I think basically he's just like well, obviously it's not a real problem or it's not a really big problem because if it was these other things would be happening. So yeah him telling me you've expressed frustrations with a lot of managers in the past. I was kind of kind of like yes in really horrible experiences. That like I don't know. I felt like he was saying I am in argumentative. recalcitrant employee, which I don't think I am usually\n",
            "Doctor: That seems like it was a quite a hurtful conversation.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, he actually did ask me if I was upset. If he said like at the beginning like this might hurt your feelings, but I think the problem is that you're is you're not diplomatic and asking that sort of thing. It was nice that he was kind of aware that this might hurt my feelings, but I think that part for my feelings. But I think the part that hurt my feelings, isn't that like? Oh, you're right. I am. I don't know I'm too or I'm too whatever. It's not that there's Behavior happy that I don't want to admit. It's more like he won't. I just feel like he doesn't I don't know. It's not he started talking about about it as this I had a personal failing which is which it's not a personal feelings and in institutional feeling.\n",
            "Doctor: Originally, you're feeling really vulnerable upset and frustrated about something and he's not being supportive about that and also telling you it's your fault.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah part of the thing with the Ben Franklin story is part of me thought. Oh, right, you worked in business where there are books the blah method in the blah method and 360 eval whatever but also is very much the well, here's the solution you didn't think of I was like actually did think of trying to Pharmacy in that didn't work.\n",
            "Doctor: Tell me about is like you're his daughter and he's saying you failed to be diplomatic. You know what I mean? I know he's not sitting next to you at work. But you talk to a lot of people and say a lot of things and his saying that he thinks you're not good at communicating without giving examples of things. He seen firsthand or that he imagines you're not diplomatic without explaining why he thinks that's based on his own sense of you. I don't know I guess makes I imagined could feel like he's disconnected.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I think that's yeah a part of why it's really bothering me is I definitely have a sense of myself as being able to communicate. Well, I was upset and I need to have my dad be like, nope. That thing you thought you think you're good at you're not and when I think about things I'm good at doing in a workplace. It's definitely one of them one of the big ones. I think I'm like, oh I communicate I can communicate and all right way blah blah blah. I have people and yeah. I'm just kind of like I don't know I went to Cambridge and got an honors degree in Humanities by know how to write an essay. I can I think that's what you spent a lot of money for me to learn.\n",
            "Doctor: You guys have sat at the dinner table probably plenty of times. Do you come across as somebody who has trouble communicating?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I sent a message. I know I should not be threatened. But yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You guys have the communication thing. You guys have the communication thing.\n",
            "Patient: yeah the only thing that I don't do very well as public speaking but that's a really great public speaker yeah it's really weird because it's very much a to me the wake I'm like that's not my dad just let someone else who isn't in any in any like there's a public speaker Persona sort of yeah it's just kind of like a work schmoozing Persona I mean it's still him but it's very like what just happened he's really gregarious and working the room and all these things and it's just kind of weird to me I have stage fright and he doesn't I'm kind of like all right you know I think I feel like he's seen me communicating basically all the ways except trying to do public speaking and also other people say that I'm better at it than I think\n",
            "Doctor: at Publix\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: haha\n",
            "Patient: Which I can accept maybe I don't know. I just get so nervous about it. But also it kind of feels like sort of in this like there's two sides me and Chet or management. I feel like he's kind of picking not my side which feels horrible and really weird and it's really discouraging in terms of just I try to think about how they're working hard and other places are different in other like But like my dad a my dad and be a person with a very different HR perspective having both these people like know the problem was you. And just makes me feel that this is a problem that just let's just not that it's going to drive me crazy until I retire. I don't know get him a car for Grant which doesn't really it does not make me feel great about career prospects or anything because I've been having this very much last four month or months with why I'm going to go to library school why I'm spending all this money and time. Almost since I'm going since I'm going to get ahead anyway, blah blah blah and it feels like it's just sort of another Community confirmation that I'm not going to exceed to succeed and not changing institutions changing Coast changing whatever having a professional degree won't help. I mean the other Prospect the other aspects someone I know asked me to contribute to a panel. She's proposing at a library conference in conference in March a thing, which was she said to talk about. Is ways in which or part of it? Is she feels like there other app? Spec's in her of her personal life and political activism and I've also helped her as a librarian sort of conceptually. He's learned all these things like making zines for 10 years in a way it ended up being a form of professional development because she knows how to XYZ is through the only in for my information about accessibility Contra my spare time. So I think a really good idea will be like would be like yeah things I do for my off-time of relevant and important but I also get the reason I've been so I've been worried that if my co-workers or if I if it came out I don't know instead of being worried about my coworker is sort of invading my privacy online like their privacy like my personal privacy and work. I'm like God if they if I was more vocal about my clinical use at work, which I am not. Or if I was like or if I was just really like that's really racist instead of doing a huge dance around it. Not saying anything. That would negatively affect everything now. Let it go. God. Maybe I shouldn't.\n",
            "Doctor: time's almost up\n",
            "Patient: I know.\n",
            "Doctor: You take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hey, come on in. Thank you.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you. Good morning.\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: So I'm not sure where to start again. We left off last time, you know being in the middle of things I guess but not really like it's sort of like we talked and talked and then we get to really hard things men fashion eventually wives down or ends, but I don't know how to pick right back up to where we were.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it feel like there were particular hard things that we keep getting too or does it just feel like lots of hard things come up?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know maybe some of both I think mostly I think I at least try to talk about anything except Tanya and eventually we get talking about Tanya and that's just hard at least that's what I feel like today. I don't really know.\n",
            "Doctor: And does it feel like you talk about everything except Tanya because you want to make sure that you get a chance to talk about other things or do you feel like you're avoiding talking about Tanya?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's sort of a lot of times. I find smaller problems generalized in a way. Like if we can solve something less important maybe that will speak to something more important and it will be easier to do so. I think it's something more like that, but I'm not sure. You know, it's like we talked about this brown students and taxes and means nothing important at all. But there's something about relating to other people that involved in it. So Tanya, I might just go going to Jumping to talking about Tanya then I guess so she continues to do well in the scale of the last several months. I think so mean and she's depressed but not near suicidal. That's that's good. I can't remember last week if she had surged trying to reconstruct the last several months of her life or not. She doesn't really remember them. So it's particular when she was doing ECT, but even reaching out much farther back than that. She said she can't really remember what it's like a brown or why she couldn't handle it or what was going on. That made it so hard. Which you know, it's like the last two and a half years. And so I find myself in this position of a certainty for the last several months. I've actually been here. I know exactly what it's been going on as much as I can see her from the outside before that. I have a general sense of what was going on. I was in there every day and I don't know how fundamentally I don't know why she could handle what was going on at Brown. I can tell through sort of the thing. She talks about what those are mostly useful as ways of reminding people that say it said before not as good descriptors of what went on but she can't remember what she said before. What she felt before so that's not useful. She got all of these journals because particularly when she gets depressed or when she was hospitalized. She writes the journal a whole lot. She has this view of she at least over the last several years that had this point of view of depression as being sort of the month Felix thing that was imposed upon her as if no external causes in her situation can possibly be related to it. So we're making it not very helpful because we talked about how she feels and not what's going on that is most certainly related to how she feels up a time but now we drifted away into the causes of Tony has depression, which is big in a sense fundamentally unanswerable question. Like why is she depressed? Maybe it's not I mean, I guess I would like to have feedback on that. You think it's on answerable?\n",
            "Doctor: It depends on the type of answer you're looking for I don't mean to be intentionally invasive.\n",
            "Patient: Know what that's okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean is\n",
            "Patient: To what type of answer is it answerable?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm not I'm saying that and then I'm realizing I'm not actually sure that what the like if I had actually categorized this kind of answer. Is that kind of answer? You know, there's like the question of why do bad things happen to good people, right? Is a question answerable. Well, you can find you can create answers and mini boy answers to it. But their answers are not you know their type of answer.\n",
            "Patient: You can sort of get to this how it have.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, you can certainly get to a description and you can certainly get to a system of meaning-making words answerable. I mean, it's well, I'm serious though, you know a lot of religions tackle this and they have a way to answer it.\n",
            "Patient: But it's very much one of constructing some sort of reality in which there's answers to that sort of question.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so can you then tease out the percentage of biology and the percentage of environment? No, I mean, although I imagine that's not quite what you mean. I don't think you would know that you would think that way anyway.\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't know that's sort of what I meant by fundamentally and then answer that I think like it happened. We can be pretty sure of that.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, so even gets this to the point of environment and maybe this gets to the difference between biology and environment people have horrible traumatic experience and are kind of okay in life and people have less horrible experiences and go through life like completely disorganized and miserable. I mean,\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Why does that happen? And maybe an important part maybe the important maybe the important point. I'm thinking as I'm talking in order to think in a sense is that I mean that maybe the point for you is that how can you make sense of it? It may not be the answer because there may not be the answer. But what kind of sounds can you make of it? And Tanya may make her own sense. You may have a shared sense, but you need to make sense of it to because it's your experience with her as your wife and your life, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I can make sense of and I can make sense of it. Well enough and on the other hand, I can't make sense of it at all, I guess. Yeah, it's sort of like our best scientific evidence suggests that the biology and the environment are entangled and Subway like their environment Iran continues to shape you throughout the time in the actual physical way in recent studies that strongly support that it's good. It's interesting, but it doesn't we could talk about Mind Body divide and all that but I don't know that matter. Is it also when she had a particular set of suspect abilities that the environment at Brown really played on it despite counseling with an absurd number of people regularly and couldn't deal with it and couldn't deal with it and couldn't develop a way of dealing with it. When I guess the piece that I really can't get a grip on is where it came to suicidally because there's this option of just walking away from where she is but I think that for her she couldn't see it. Option I think that in part because she couldn't see the depression as a thing X parade by her surroundings or something like that. And so I can't make sense of it, but the is Halloween some way because sort of just rationalizing all the pieces not one that I can share with her in any meaningful way because she doesn't remember and so You know, there's an interesting description of it as an illness itself has progressed across Generations in her family. So go her parents parents were really terrible parents just didn't seem to like children were angry all the time towards the children at their existence or something like that which left their father with anger issues in the mother with abandonment issues and then they got married and their anger and abandonment issues together and so her mother left and her father yelled a lot and then left her with both sets of issues, which they have played out in a relationship probating the traumas that were handed to her to me.\n",
            "Doctor: What are you thinking about?\n",
            "Patient: I'm thinking I'm her I'm angry about it and she's coming back to the abyss in a lot of ways and she doesn't remember things being and she can just tell that she was in it because she's coming back from it. And there's sense in which she expects me to be a partner to her. I don't really trust her and you know, I think I love her but often I just feel so many negative emotions like pain and anger.\n",
            "Doctor: I can see how troubled You Are by this I can see it and I can understand it to.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks, but I don't think about I don't I don't know what to do about it. So, you know you suggest about talking about it can help and I'm talking about it. But other than that, I don't really know what to do.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, there's so many layers to it. There are at least two which is the feelings you have and then the implications to the feelings you have are possible application.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess the implications part is the to do about it part and possibly somehow linked to that what you do about it. What does it mean for you? What does it mean to Tonya? What does it mean to your relationship? What does it mean about the future of your relationship expectations you had modifications and expectations possible modifications and expectations because how can you possibly know?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like you got a pretty good handle on them. And there's a sense in which I think that's particularly hard to deal with for me because it falls into a repeated class of failures for me. So like I grew up in a religious organization that had totally corrupt leadership. I had these expectations of going to college and it being the filling time of you know, reading and learning and growing with a community of people want to do the same which I did find a very small community of people who are very like-minded, but it was not very not that Full Celine undergraduate school for not similar reasons, but actually with similar expectations and really not the same. It's just an Ohio in a particular. Everyone is very very busy and doesn't recognize to extent to which they're missing and the real Conjuring ality in the department. It's really hard to see it be part of it and deal with again. I have these expectations of marriage of some sort of partnership that we had made a sort of plan together to do this graduate school sayings get through it together. She had just gone gone. It feels like this thing happened in some way, you know a place that will But I won't snuff surprised and it happened in graduate school. I sort of went well. Okay, what do we do about it? And so I stopped on a lot of communities in an effort to make it a better place for the next set of people because it's not a thing that's going away. I don't know what to do here. You know, I'm doing well or very nearly all the house chores for two people for 6 months or longer in addition to working and trying to take care of Tanya manager care what other people are taking care of her and you know, she's now in this place of can't remembering things because of the e c t that she did and innocence on my watch right? So it's which can't remember things and I feel like at least a little bit of it my fault even though I'm not sure if I could have made any different decisions. So now I'm talking faster than you can respond or something but\n",
            "Doctor: You don't talk very fast.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: You're doing fine. I'm not itching to respond.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I think response would be helpful. Even if you aren't itching to.\n",
            "Doctor: Because you're feeling lost in this.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I can say these things to myself right just saying them. It's not often but enough if I can just acknowledge that but I'm not sure that's enough here. I know what has happened. I don't know what to do.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I think here's one of the difficulties. There's a lot of difficulties difficulties seems like such a generic word, but there's a feeling of like what has happened. How do you even make sense of that and work through it the sort of disappointment the pain and the anger and that's a piece of it the other piece of it maybe which is larger. I don't know is what are the implications for the future in your marriage? It's not simply just working out or try to work through something sort of terrible that has happened in your recent past but it's what does this mean for your future which is a really that's huge. And I feel like I started thinking about where your expectations come from. There are probably a lot of ways to think about this but I thought of three things in one particular kind of way of thinking about it. There are your hopes and dreams you could say or your hopes and dreams come from but let's put that aside for now. Your experience I expect this because in my experience it's happened before and promises that people makes you that you then expect them to fulfill. I'm so in all three areas. This has been awarded for you. Certainly. These are not part of your hopes. This was not part of your experience. Tanya was depressed in the past. But this level of depression was not part of your experience. And this has nothing this is the antithesis of what she promised you in terms of being your wife and being your partner.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't feel like her feeling in her promises. Give me an excuse to fail in mine. It's that certainty in regular and regular contracts off. Obviously that voids the contract but it's not how I view this particular engagement for marriage literally but Arrangements. You know, then there's the question of does this matter what you know, if she's not responsible responsible for the illness can be angry with her and some sense. That is the thing that happened to her as much as it happened to me. But if she's responsible for the illness, then it's a thing she did as well as what happened to her. I don't know why it really matters, but it seems to\n",
            "Doctor: I would imagine responsibility would matter for most people and then I would also say in particular for you in addition to that it's your personal ethic in a very broad sense that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think that's about right.\n",
            "Doctor: But it's also important I mean you know I mean because she had something or she felt suicidal and what she did with that which is talk about it threatened it others would threaten it as you know\n",
            "Patient: yeah, I know I\n",
            "Doctor: There's actions about her that it hurt you it hurt her too, but it hurt you. I'm so you're wondering is she responsible for hurting you or could she not do anything about hurting you?\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: and that matters\n",
            "Patient: Sure. Sure seems to matter to me. Yeah, it's her. She does not like the idea of having hurt me. But mostly I think she's just pleased that she didn't kill herself, which is fair. I'm glad she didn't kill herself also, but\n",
            "Doctor: but even saying that I get the sense, it's sort of like that's a pretty low bar.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Like great. Okay, but\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know. I mean on one hand. It's a level bar on the other hand is a really high bar.\n",
            "Doctor: I can understand that.\n",
            "Patient: You know, I think it really does matter that she didn't kill herself. I also think it's also matters that you didn't try although. When you get to the point of making a plan and getting ready to execute the line between that and trying doesn't seem like a large lines me, but not that big of a deal.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think she understands that she may need to do things to regain your trust?\n",
            "Patient: I think she's heard those words and understood them, but I think I'm but I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure she would not have any idea. How the process would go?\n",
            "Doctor: well, I would think that would be true for you to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think less so maybe not I don't want to speak prematurely.\n",
            "Patient: That's okay. Yeah, I guess I don't have as you know, I don't have a very clear sense of How It Go but yeah. Yeah, I don't have a clear sense of how it go. But I and I don't have a clear sense of how we go in the same time when she was filled Crest like let's be clear. I don't think she's I don't know even that word to be used normal. I'm not sure I think she's still depressed but not nearly as bad and then so then yeah, I don't know that she's thinking very hard about the future so much as dealing with the present and the guy got to be awful not to remember the last several years that's got to be terrible, but I don't actually have as much sympathy left for her, which is horrible or I think it's horrible, but\n",
            "Doctor: It's horrible that you have your limits.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, sure. I mean, that's right. I shouldn't have any more minutes. I said that jokingly but\n",
            "Doctor: I know I was going to say let's talk about some expectations. You know what the human being is capable of let's talk about expectations.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and so, you know, I think I'm better than other people. Maybe I have an articulated that in so many words before but I feel like I've tried to say that and so I have pretty high expectations for myself to be able to handle these things. And for the most part I can't so that any space between handling it perfectly and where I can actually am is not always but sometimes that's space in which I'm failing because I can see how you would handle it better, but I can't it's not some significant sufficient to say well under these circumstances a person normally handles it this way because it's very few aspects among the life and which I have been normal, you know, sometimes I can deal with that. Sometimes I can't that's an ongoing struggle to say. Under ideal conditions. I would handle it this way. These are not ideal conditions.\n",
            "Doctor: It did seem like when you said Tanya would have no idea what that would look like, but it sounded like you had more than no idea.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like a way forward for us is for her not to reply to me alone right now. Like she has friends and family and then get them to help her deal with the problems of now are less severe and that we can help with and that's you know, I've asked her to talk to her friends and her family about the memory loss and she's both because she has a tendency to try and hide things like this and because I can't reconstruct every conversation. She had with another person for her or what she did with these peoples often. I only hear what Tanya told me and don't remember it now or remember it just be receipt house because it's just What's so I think she will do that. Just\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I was going to ask to feel like she's responsive to that when you ask her.\n",
            "Patient: you know, she seems to think that made sense and that she would do that in so I think she will I think it will take her time. I think she will continue to rely on me for you know day today sport in a variety of ways.\n",
            "Doctor: do you feel that she understands that you're saying that not simply for her benefit, but for your benefit to\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: That's important. If she feels like you're just trying to be helpful to her then you know, she can sort of do what seems like it might be helpful to her but not about what you need which is which is different motivation.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, and I can't remember now what I actually said, which would you know whether I said I think you need to or I need you to I can't remember which I said at the time. I mean the other piece other piece of this is like how do I have conversations with her where I say that like I can't support you right now. I can't do that.\n",
            "Doctor: What's the how part?\n",
            "Patient: I hope heart is like both practically and murali like that is the thing that will hurt her. It's not like I haven't had pieces of that conversation over the last several months a couple months.\n",
            "Doctor: What's the moral piece?\n",
            "Patient: If I know that an action I take is going to hurt her and I take that action then there's some sense of me trying to deliberately hurt her.\n",
            "Doctor: I can see where this is going to go this conversation, but she took actions that hurt her intent was not to hurt you but they hurt you just like the intent would not be to hurt her but they might hurt her. I'm not arguing you should do a tit-for-tat. I'm just simply.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, this is for the responsibilities question comes in. In though, doesn't it if we fight I don't feel like she did that to hurt me but I feel like she could reasonably understood both given her childhood and her first long-term relationship, but she had an emotionally abusive boyfriend who was depressing friend to kill himself if she didn't do whatever.\n",
            "Doctor: Really?\n",
            "Patient: I mean something like horrible horrific terrible things have happened to her and I get that and that's a bad but that should make him work through to her that doing these things is not okay not and so should make it more clear to me that doing these things is not okay not less. So it's like, you know\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I would argue that what we're talking about with you. There's a more productive and goal. There's a more productive end the goal than with her what she did.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's probably correct.\n",
            "Doctor: It does make and especially when I think about what happened between her and this professor before you guys got married. It doesn't make me think very much in the model of helping a relationship heal in the face of infidelity. Not even that actually test. And when someone betrays your trust in a very deep way, we sort of Define infidelity like that. How do you help a relationship heal? And that's what we're talking about in terms of regaining her trust. And of course there was a previous infidelity which may not have even been probably wasn't as dramatic for you as this one. We're a matched amorphous structure of what we think of infidelity, but then there's this\n",
            "Patient: No, it's interesting that that keeps coming to mind. Like I thought I had more or less put that to rest but other infidelity, but it's interesting that comes to mind when I'm angry now, even though I even though I really at least don't think or do you think I forgave her? Had words to heal. Mostly. I think that the analogy is good and interesting one.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's a betrayal of like sort of the very I mean, I guess you could sort of I don't know if you can frame a lot of things into betrayal of trust because that's what it's a very specific way. But there's certainly I guess there's ways in which people don't meet our expectations and then their expectations that seemed so foundational on basic that when those expectations are not met or worded. That's that's betrayal of trust like somewhere. There's some, you know Continuum, but I should think about it more\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know. I mean it seems like there's some definitional expectations or something. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But I'm not in a very practical way and I'm not saying it should be now, but I just think how you guys started with me. I think it would be helpful for the two of you to have a couples therapist. It wouldn't be me anymore, but we talked about this.\n",
            "Patient: Clearly yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: The get-go in terms of we switched but you know, especially if I I think it would be helpful anyway, but then when I put it in the framework of regaining trust, which I really think couples need an outside party to do when there's been a violation of trust. I don't really maybe it's not possible. It seems close to impossible to heal on your own. I really do think you need the presence of a third-party. I mean a trained third-party but another to help with that. It seems so foundational to a relationship and we could talk and we could talk about practicat. And we could talk about practically if you want to do it when you want to do it when it would even make sense if Tanya was open to doing it again when that would be but I do think that would be an important piece probably in both of your healing processes. What are we thinking there?\n",
            "Patient: I'm thinking that's an interesting suggestion. I think it makes sense. You know, it gives me a window into why are you would do what you do also, and I think it's interesting.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you mean?\n",
            "Patient: Well, if you think that it's almost impossible for couples to heal from you, then that somebody needs to do it. There's a good reason to do it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think I'm hopeful two couples in a lot of ways like be a lot of ways but certainly that in my opinion. That's one way in which I think it's virtually impossible for a couple to do it on their own. I think in most other ways it's very helpful to and maybe I don't know I have to think about it more maybe there's a lot of ways but then I think it's a virtually impossible but that in particular just comes to mind. and it has so many of the characteristics of infidelity because one question that when there's An affair is how do I know he won't do it again?\n",
            "Patient: Sure.\n",
            "Doctor: and so\n",
            "Patient: Sure, it's the same question of responsibility and I'm player.\n",
            "Doctor: is there\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I guess there is often.\n",
            "Doctor: Not quite right. I mean there's definitely differences. It's not the exact same thing. There is a question. It's not quite like this though. There is definitely more assumed responsibility, you know, I think in the case of an affair, it seems more volitional potentially more volitional. But you have a much better vocabulary to describe it but it seems like there are responsibilities that are your worth because they're by definition in your control and there are responsibilities that may or may not be in your control at least from moment to Moment by signing up for them and make you an obligation to another person is still your responsibility even if moment-to-moment. It doesn't seem like they're in your control and those are still responsibilities.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that sounds like more or less right? Yeah. Yeah, and then they're just like, you know in a sense of like how it's good thing to be nice to people and that it's particularly a good thing to be nice to people who are in pain. So if Tanya is still in a lot of pain I should be nicer but I'm also angry it's hard being nice when I'm angry.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's good to be nice to people who you love.\n",
            "Patient: That's true to ya.\n",
            "Doctor: and you feel that way to her, but she feels sad, you know, you could find a lot of categories that don't fall under obligation, but\n",
            "Patient: Well, and so this is when things right like this is why the brown students and their taxes are so relevant like they're not meeting their obligations, but it doesn't change what I need to do. So obviously I don't love them. So that's the issue. But I feel like you're arguing for some sort of society in my perceptions and I just\n",
            "Doctor: Actually not maybe before a little bit. I wasn't necessarily suggesting that.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I was more so it's saying two kinds of categories of responsibility not represent us attorney for someone.\n",
            "Patient: I see I see.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, we're going to need to stop there for today.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Because I'll see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: All right.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: You're good.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I think that once preschool I'll end up driving on Tuesdays, but just something it's I driven once and it's opposite direction for traffic. So it's not bad.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I imagine parking around here would be.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I would just walk back to my apartment because it's really easy to part around my apartment weirdly. Like I wasn't expecting that but yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Also, I'm sorry about the bill.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, that's right. So it was a good trip.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: You know, it's sort of odd starting again, you know, like when you go on a weekend trip, it doesn't actually feel like a weekend. They're really good friends like very into us they seemed very relaxed about it, which is nice.\n",
            "Doctor: That's nice.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they were in Ohio where the wife Carrie was director of stocks and bonds and then her adviser moved to Springfield. And so now they're like half an hour away from her family, which is like nice and also bad. So yeah why we were there we helped Cody set up the crib because they're calling every other day to ask do you have The crib set up yet, and they're like the baby's not going to sleep in the crib until it's like at least several months old. It's really okay. So they took a picture of us with the crib and said it it made me feel like the benefits of neglect for my parents. Like well, it wasn't great when I was a kid. But at this point either that whatever they think is okay is like make comments about my weight. For example. Yeah, it's not all that great. It was good for James and I should be able to like we should really long ride together. We talked about his field and what we're going to do and after you finish his degree and where we want to be and what we found and what we would want to be doing. We pretty much agreed that we don't want to be back in Columbus, and we wouldn't want to be in the Midwest. Did some breathing space and James got to take a couple of days off and that was good. I told Cody and Carrie about the ECT and we touch on we talked about that sure. They just want to know about it and asking interesting questions. So we talk. I feel like James and I are really worried that I will suddenly get dramatically worse. Amazingly enough. James doesn't like it when I make jokes about suicide and sometimes I forget them. I was sorry. Maybe it's one thing that would be good for a while. My roommate finally emailed me back.\n",
            "Doctor: from\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and was like, yeah, that sounds great in like July. She's going to come. I don't know. I just think we're sort of on the same page. You're a nice person whom I like and we're probably not going to be friends. I'm pretty okay with that. I was thinking she takes a lot of work. She probably feels the same way about me.\n",
            "Doctor: She takes a lot of work.\n",
            "Patient: It takes a lot of work to be her friends.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, yeah, I see.\n",
            "Patient: It's good to be around friends. James sounds like he feels like he doesn't make friends easily. and I feel like it's easy for me to make friends, but I tend to make friends with people who are kind of like Katy Perry's husband, he talks like so much. He just talked for 48 hours. It's amazing. I go to bed and he be talking and I'd get up and meet me talkin and he talked it's great. It's not like he's talking about the same things. He just has a lot of ideas. I don't know what to talk about. So I feel like if I hold my nose just so everything will be okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: It isn't like\n",
            "Doctor: What were you going to say? Here is that you're not sure it will be the right thing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah a little bit. I was pretty bad a few weeks ago like just beginning of the weekend. I was real sad, and I'm not right now. And so I'm just babbling on.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, but I also imagine that you're quite worried that even if you feel like you're feeling like you're leaving a lot of high moral, you know, you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Are you that happens sometimes?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. Are you sure that that's just the right thing you could say?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that stuff. I can't figure out what that is, but that's okay. It seems like you know, it seems like that's all they just seem. Unclear which particular personally I think is right and partially is really anxious. Oh, well, I better not mess with anything. Yeah, I don't know at what point I start feeling safe. I think it would be more like must I start feeling safe then more than I forget that I am not safe, and I'm not.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: It's not that recognizing that I'm not save doesn't begin to protect me or anything like that.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think like an If you're sort of Blindsided the same way and you can look out for it and prepare yourself for it a little bit better. Things are getting really bad.\n",
            "Patient: What you said to him last week was very helpful. Yeah, what's going on with James is also not monolithic. Speaking of save a story from my childhood my grandparents. I might have told you the story already. My grandparents lived in this nice big old cabin, not really a cabin but like a wood house on and as they got older they were really I suspect they were really never much for cleanliness based on the way. I was raised my standards from are different from other people's as I have learned like soap is necessary good to know so like\n",
            "Doctor: These are your grandparents.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they never really like nothing ever got clean. There was like a film of grease on their clean dishes and like all their food would go bad in the fridge. Like they just left it there. They probably shouldn't have been living there by themselves but like no one was going to tell them what to do.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I was like 10 or so and we are visiting and we had a friend of the family visiting us to have never been there before so he was trying to make coffee and like where is the coffee pot? And he pulled some milk out of the fridge and turned and said is this safe and we were like nothing is safe. I'm not telling some of my dad's I'm not telling some of my dad's favorite stories about his parents at this point or about our interactions with his parents. Did not eat anything the whole trip. We'd like bring food every time we came. Was maybe four or five maybe a little bit older but not much and being their drink daffodil season and they have like thousands of daffodils and I just picked them all. I just think all of them and put them all over the house and they were totally fine with that. I ended up talking about family with Carrie. I think Terry's family is driving Cody kind of meds. I think Vincent to us was a way of continuing to be gracious to them. Where say people you know, they're thinking a lot about family about to have a kid thinking about them a little sad James and I are so far from that don't necessarily have to Yeah, we're just not ready to have a kid. I think both of us would like to be.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you have something else that your depression has a hand in that's not working out for the time being.\n",
            "Patient: I really can't take care of James right now.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Can take care of a child and also more broadly. I mean I can really see the ways that the crazy has been passed down through the generations to me and like I don't know how to make it stop.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you mean?\n",
            "Patient: Play both sides of my grandparents is nuts or were you know, yeah pretty unhappy and neither kids pretty unhappy and now I'm pretty unhappy. I don't know how you stop that.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I had a face with encounter with my aunt who is my mom's sister who was a psychologist even moved to Utah to be an artist. She's nuts.\n",
            "Doctor: I never said you weren't.\n",
            "Patient: I try to avoid talking about psychology with her. She's always ends up talking about that's just not helpful for me.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: You know in some ways it makes sense growing up in the household. She did of course. She's a psychologist adults you figure out the shit out. I really want to have a family I want to have children.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: In a lot of ways, I think I'd be really good at it.\n",
            "Doctor: I think there's a lot of things that you learned about here and are sorts of things that can kind of help stop the buck, you know.\n",
            "Patient: Like now, I mean, I don't mean that I do actually when I said that I feel like the more I sort of get better. Whatever that looks like. I just feel like the pressure is on to be well.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it does seem to me that you're sort of walking along the edge of a cliff here. And if you say the wrong thing or I say the wrong thing. It's just going to turn you off. Like you're the and the two had a better just to do it right and maybe to me to something by faster us is going to happen.\n",
            "Patient: I want to say that I think that's too much pressure for Chad.\n",
            "Doctor: As long as we're clear whom we're looking for out here.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I don't never going to I know that I just can't stop both trying and feeling like it's vitally important that I do.\n",
            "Doctor: Is kind of accurate in the way or I mean representative Lee that you would be worried about what will happen to me and the pressure that's on me in the same way that in one of your Chief worries about things getting really bad against again as to James and how you would do and the two of you would do and where that would leave you. I see.\n",
            "Patient: Like you and James always have the option of leaving and never feeling pressured.\n",
            "Doctor: You mean to you?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you thought about?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I have well. Behind this I feel that we can have a better life without me and for me when I think about James leaving me. I just can't handle it all there's nothing after that.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. I feel that a part of you is feeling really really bad.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, probably.\n",
            "Doctor: And that maybe we were talking about it as though things are okay, and you should go back there and your thoughts I guess about James are really in both places.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it does.\n",
            "Doctor: I know. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like when I'm worried about things getting bad, I feel like things could be bad tomorrow or even today and like\n",
            "Doctor: You're getting pretty close to feeling that James and I would be better off without you.\n",
            "Patient: but I'm not sure that I would ever leave James. I feel like at least now that if you push me hard, I would always say that.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, that strikes me is pretty upset depressed. And feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, but sometimes that is a lot. Sometimes the attitude that people would be better off without me just gets immediately answered by you know, that's not the way things are and I'm glad you're in my life and so it will be okay.\n",
            "Doctor: When you feel that way you have your feelings are mixed around about having any way in that from him. It can be and taking care of you in a certain ways and the other having to worry about us about how you're doing. When were going to leave and that you're feeling you're not going to be able to put up with it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: whatever But you're going to stay it's going to be really hurt whether we that way or not.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I worry about every about people getting hurt by me. You know, I think what I was thinking about suicide a lot at least part of it was at least I won't have to see it when I inevitable having to see it or\n",
            "Doctor: We should stop.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, how are you? How is going your week?\n",
            "Patient: So I've been fairly anxious this week about a few different things. I've been working on the same paper for the last couple months. It's sort of been my big paper that I want to talk about and job interviews. So I've been trying to finish it before I send out applications, but I need to both send out applications because I need to have a job and I also because there's sort of like I'm anxious about there where we will be. I can understand that uncertainty. I don't really like I feel like I've been putting her in a position of uncertainty for a while and the concerns are there. So I finish that paper Sunday, which is a good thing, but it's sort of anxiety attached to will I ever finish this just to get it done already. So I'm already in like To the job portion of I feel like I have to find the right job, you know on one level so that my wife doesn't kill herself and I'm on another level but I'm happy somewhere for the next couple years on another level so that I pick the right ones so that I have a career that I want even though. I don't exactly have a know what for your I really want it matters what I do next. And then in to the actual production process of sending out applications, I'm I think I mentioned that in chemistry almost all the post office ocean want to send applications to people so you noted that I like to construct rules to govern my environment or something that particular feature is a strengthened some areas when there is actually acting position for a job. I write an application that indicates why I would be a good match for the position when there is no posting. I know that the person who is reading it will still have a set of criteria. Well, I have no access to what these prices are really are. So I have the sense of what I have to say the right thing. I have to explain like how I would be a good fit for this position that may or may not exist based on criteria that I have not have no access to so I can I find that nerve-wracking. There's a sense in which all of it is. Okay, it's hard to deal with it and it makes me feel less efficient the work that I'm doing. I'm like, I just need to get through it and it's okay. Did you finish your paper? I can get things done. I'll get the application done probably today or tomorrow and I'll be sending them out. Sitting here looking for a good seat. Another thing about I've been anxious about a sort of where we left things last week. There's been less pressing in several days last several days, and I've been pretty much more anxious about other things. Certain things have been on my mind also. So there that's your series of questions not really related to each other. I don't want to come back to the last two at a moment's but start with which one you go.\n",
            "Doctor: I bought that one.\n",
            "Patient: From oversea Reebok that it I'm sensitive that particular thing. So I asked if this was your first pregnancy and you sort of that moment in which disengage from directly asking a question and started I felt like harvesting more defensively you were more reluctant to answer some questions. That is that I believe that you were more reluctant to answer that. I could be wrong in that we recognize that this is the premise under wish I was operating here. We talked a lot after I asked about that Aunt why I'm so curious about your pregnancy. And so I can send you the thing about that question. I think there were several things going on. Like I said a big snarl of things here. So just trying to keep talking and see what will get. So I think the two things that I don't remember talking exclusively about our one I really want to have a family. So in a sense you have this thing that I pretty much want in don't really see how I'm going to have because I don't really I just don't I really get used to want to have children with Tanya and addition to wanting to have children. Not sure what I want to have if I want to have children with Tanya. I don't know if she can handle it. I don't you know, so there's But I feel like there's maybe a sense in which I'm trying to appropriate your pregnancy, which sounds horrible. I'm sorry if it is potentially a thing, but I'm doing\n",
            "Doctor: When you say appropriate, how do you mean?\n",
            "Patient: Like take a piece of it or something for myself, which is why it sounds horrible to me. I think another piece that's going on most of the women in my life one way or another are are having pregnant. That's just sort of like both of my sisters are pregnant and have them pregnant. One of them is pregnant right now went into labor recently over the weekend is an in labor anymore. So another nice in a week or so, probably which is wonderful. I'm excited about it. So I just have a clear sense that it's not an easy thing but it hasn't seemed to affect you at all in terms of your work life, which is great. I think I can only assume speaks your ability to like keep yourself separate and safe. But there's this sense I have I think that this is must be a challenging for you because it's challenging for everyone else I've done so I feel like I'm trying to say it's okay for it to I don't need like you're going away on maternity leave like there's a reason they have maternity leave because like, you know, it's an important fit.\n",
            "Doctor: How is that related to being challenging or is it separate?\n",
            "Patient: No, no, I I mean that's in my mind. We have this maternity leave because one needs maternity leave after childbirth in order to recover relate to the child take care of the child's needs all so we have some social social algae accommodation there. So it's sort of like it's not a secret but it's hard I guess is the other is how it it was related.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I think there's also the sense that one of the things I'd like to do in my other relationship is he aware of things that people are struggling with and sort of offer to talk with them in about them sort of tell them that I understand this is going on. So I think that I'm trying to do that and realize our relationships very different from my other ones, but I think that I'm doing that other ways. So I think that's part of it. I think those are like the important things. I'm glad to have them said and thought about I think they're important but none of them none of those or any things of the other things many things that I've said on this topic actually get the how did it come to be the case that I asked the question. It's all related because I do have all those things but I actually how it came to be is some long time ago. I asked you whether this would be your first child. And you said it would be your first biological child. So a couple weeks ago, I sort of and then I raised a question very carefully to avoid asking the question that I then later asked you like I did that because anyway So a couple weeks ago, I sort of talked as if this were your first pregnancy and in so harvesting you you inquired as to why I would think that was the case and you were curious about that and I sort of responded very quickly that you had told me even shortly after that but the reflecting later it's really not what you are told me. Why what you're told me is that this is your first child because that's what I had asked deliberately went on to the question. And so I felt like perhaps it I had been dismissed very real and very trying struggles of yours and don't really don't want to have done that. And so I asked a question believing that it was likely that becoming pregnant has been a challenge and has been hard like a traumatic thing and other times for you because I wanted to I guess apologize for dismissing that so that's how it came to be.\n",
            "Doctor: Amazon hope that had I had a miscarriage or had an abortion or something like this. I guess those were the two conditions under which I would be pregnant and not have a child's right? I guess. Those are the only two that I would say more about that or just that it would be acknowledged or what would happen.\n",
            "Patient: That's a good question. Yeah, so when asking questions and thinking about it, I had a desire to tell you that I feel sorry for the messing that experience and also to tell you that I was sorry for your loss if that were the case, that's about as far as it went. Like I don't sort of like I sort of like if I accidentally stepped on your foot when I was walking in here. I might say did that hurt and then I would apologize for stepping on your foot. Normally. I would probably just apologize because I'm sure it would hurt but like if I weren't sure I might ask first like a crappy metaphor for What I think was going on. I was actually want to know but it's like I also recognize that it's a level of knowledge about you that I have no reason to expect you would want me to have and I'm really okay with that, but it's the idea that I have unintentionally stepped on you that led me to ask that question. Part of my anxiety comes from the sense that my and asking the question feeling like you sort of pulled back at that moment as if we were likes shock over shocking question and perhaps you much as if I had like in trying to fix something and I felt like I had done badly or yeah, that's pretty close. I don't know another thing I had to ask too much or something. So I'm going to move on to the other questions now. I asked you I think at the end of last session that had you ever been suicidal and whether you would lie to me you were struck by the pairing of this questions.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Rightfully, so particularly with some of that was the time constraints and some of that was that like having the sense. I've asked this question that you don't want to answer trying to give you enough other questions that you couldn't possibly answer all the questions so we can both pretend that you didn't avoid any particular. I'm still has to keep on for another question that you have more so it's So I asked so that you I asked him which clear because I had been thinking I think the day before I ask them like so I'm anxious about asking those questions for you know, the reasons about me not like asking too much for you those questions. I sort of was wondering are there any questions to which the answer my fundamentally change my view of who you are or my view my experience or my understanding of you and those were the two had you ever been suicidal? Obviously, my wife has been for a while and that has changed radically my view of first I find myself unable. Although it's not strictly. Correct the trustor unwillingly hard. Unwillingly certainly hard and so in a sense in which to answer that question has been possibly to shake me in Sunday way. Either you with you say yes, if you say yes, either my relationship you will change in a way internally or I will still a certain way or I won't and I don't and then that means something about my response to Tanya. It seems like an important question to at least talk about this part of what we're doing seemed important. I don't actually know how much it matters what the answer to the question is. And I think well, it's vaguely related. It is a lot of ways related to my friend Francia. If something is too uncomfortable for him. He just would lie to my face and I'm kind of okay with it and I'm kind of not really okay with it. I don't have I guess my feelings on that sword out. So I think that's sort of how that question came out. I don't have an actual specific to the CERN on that question. So I haven't told you what would happen. If you said yes, would you if you had Siri on what would happen to me? Give me an answer you thought I needed rather than the true answer was part of the question would you lie to me? So I guess it has two parts to it. Would you want to harvest more Harvest?\n",
            "Doctor: You're doing just fine on your own.\n",
            "Patient: But I'm done. Those are all the things that I traced out to present.\n",
            "Doctor: Really you thought about it? I will say what the question about whether I was I just sort of pause after you ask the question how I been pregnant before and it wasn't it made me think that I didn't really like that question and not my in my not liking but the reason that I began to be more focused on you is that my liking or not liking a question should not be the reason that I respond to it. So it wasn't that I was I mean, maybe it seemed like I was becoming defensive. I don't feel like, you know defensive per se I felt like I think I'm losing the point here. It came to a question where I didn't like the question to make me think maybe I need to be everything just answering your question because I think I'm losing something in that so that's why I shifted not necessarily that I was trying to avoid answering it per se.\n",
            "Patient: Are you willing to say anything more about what you mean by you didn't like the question?\n",
            "Doctor: Just I mean, I'm it doesn't really bring up anything negative, but I didn't like it wasn't like other questions. You asked me. Not a question. I wanted to answer.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: So that's what I meant by it not like I didn't approve of it but it was yeah, it was something that I was the last sort of just okay. Let's just answer that too. And then when I thought about that, I thought well my liking doing something doesn't mean that is necessarily the most productive or you know, something like that biking is a little too strong but kind of something around that.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, where did you go?\n",
            "Patient: I'm actually trying to help my wrap my head around what you said like just internalized it. It seems to be slow or something in this is with contacts. If I'm understanding correctly your internal response to the question made you question their approach to which you and taking so you change your approach. All right. I actually had nothing else other than I have read one of those books and liked it. So.\n",
            "Doctor: Which one?\n",
            "Patient: curious incident of the dog in the night-time\n",
            "Doctor: That's a good one. That's a good look very quirky.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, there's so much that you said today that you know, I would take up with you and sort of well, at least a couple things are coming to mind. The one thought I had is when you were describing just a lot of bee stings not all your questions, but a lot of your questions were about me making sure I was okay and we're like concerns about the challenges or difficulties that they have driven like a negative balance, you know, like knowing a lot of other pregnant woman and how difficult it is and like kind of a long butt pain and I was sort of struck by that.\n",
            "Patient: I think I have the sense of that one of the ways that people get through life is by sharing the joys and their sorrows with people. Normally I can I have Pasadena Terry a lot of things to sort of Carrie other people sorrow it helps. I like to I like to help people. I think that's sort of I think that's all I have are just thoughts. I think part of it is that most people not necessarily me but most people are sort of tell you or any arbitrary person things that I wish they were excited but won't necessarily say the things they're excited about that have been hard. That's where I think this is sort of the idea that being aware of somebody else's troubles in his important thing because may or may not be like coming out with it. They're almost certainly don't want to talk about it. At least a little bit having to acknowledge that this is hard or exist. There's there are probably a lot of other ways to tackle this metaphor, but those are my first responses.\n",
            "Doctor: And you feel like somebody that I would want to do to.\n",
            "Patient: No, I think not with me. I feel like it must be something you want to do. But you know your talk about taking care of yourself and having a good sport not working those imply you do these things and that was sketchy response, but it covers the whole area.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it make you feel left out in some way?\n",
            "Patient: Almost sounds like I don't have any real sense that you ought to be like. Rely on me when I share these things freezing that seem sort of absurd but I felt like I talked many times about how strange it is for me to be in a relationship. Like I share all of these intimate things and now myself like you here, perhaps occasionally mentioned passing and good things in my life, but mostly I talked about bad things you're so it's like one way our relationship is skewed and then another is like you just don't talk much about yours when the struggles over the last several weeks if I feel like it has been trying to me for me trying to take away the barriers to intimacy that I have made so that the ones that remain are natural and some sense of the ones that you're supposed. You aren't supposed to like the ones that I've made for you or wanted or something. So, I guess I want to express some uncertainty. About how I don't know. It's not for me to know like what you do don't want to share. It's part of exploring or growing or developing the relationship that we have whatever exactly it is.\n",
            "Doctor: That I'm not sure my other set of thoughts which I'm sure are related somehow is what you were saying earlier about thinking about in general perhaps my pregnancy bringing even more to the Forefront about wanting family or not wanting family or not even knowing if it's possible Tanya and clearly that's thinking about that.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I feel like I sort of said more or less that I had said on the subject. I want to say yeah, you're hearing me correctly. That is a thing. I've been thinking about Emma's part, but I guess it's not sufficient prompt to talk about it further. Is that an okay thing to say?\n",
            "Doctor: Will clearly have a lot of fears and fantasies about what this mean.\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry. What's the accident?\n",
            "Doctor: What in terms of like I mean, there's I sort of understand like I have some awareness of why you be thinking about this about Tanya in particular but it seems like there's a lot more to it than just what you said in terms of how you think about having a family or having a family. So she's working as a nanny for three small children right now. So like it's the sense in which I know that she could do. Some of the tasks of it. I guess that was particularly anxieties that I have. I guess I'll just list them or try to So that I really hate the word hormonal but you emotional and hormonal changes that occur during and after pregnancy can be very intense and particularly for someone like Sonia was already buried in some sense unstable, like right now she is relatively stable. She goes into zones of instability and we're small investors like had a disproportionate responses from her. I'm anxious about that time. Both pregnancy and postpartum. Another reason that she'll be able to she works as a nanny for hours a week. You don't take time off that's not to say that one can construct one's life. So that the children go the daycare or have a nanny the parents don't share the labor but it's always there. You don't walk away from it. Like she should or like she could always just quit her job right now. It's not okay to quit children. It's just not okay. That's exactly what her mother did to her. So there are some real similarities between her and her mother some of those are presumed genetic genetic and some of those presumably I believe like angry person raised his children and turns them into angry people and they raise children and then turn them into like the damage these to propagate regardless of the genetics of the situation also, Where do I like she's at? The fierce there one is that she will behave in a way that her mother did and one is that one is that she wants like damages that were inflicted on her on our children? Because there's a real sense that she feels and posted them on me. So I think that's a list of major concern. I can certainly see as much as you're happy for me that this has this is tough. This can be tough for me being pregnant to the extent that it you know, brings up this issue more even though it sounds like it's on your mind anyway.\n",
            "Patient: No, I actually think that you being pregnant is good thing. I'm very happy for you and hope that things will be good for you. And it sounds like it's giving us an opportunity to talk about these things. So thank you for that particular way of phrasing it, but I don't think so. Actually thank you for indulging me talking about these things while you're pregnant.\n",
            "Doctor: Indulging sound so trivial for lack of a better term. I'm not doing it to indulge you.\n",
            "Patient: You know that always brings me out this question. Why are you here? Why do we do this? Like what what? Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's certainly a non-trivial question.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, you know one of the other things that and all of this is I feel like I'm trying to work out these issues that I have with I'm working in them out that you or something. I feel like about to be challenging or something to you. So particularly and you shifting how you respond to it. I feel more anxious about it. But you having said what you said I sort of I guess I understand it better that there is no particular talking about my fears of being put off so and I'm sensitive to changes in the world around me of any kind cuz you're killing other people who knows why I just so There's something that plays into my mind praising internships there. I feel like I'm asking a lot, but you need to not be willing to give I appreciate that you. See me at all but it's also making extra time for me here. Even though I am who I am I guess or something.\n",
            "Doctor: You're anxious about what you're asking or from me on a lot of different levels.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think that's right.\n",
            "Doctor: Haha. Yeah, I think we should certainly continue to talk about because it's not just about me here.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's right.\n",
            "Doctor: We do need to stop though, but I'll see you tomorrow.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, great. Okay. Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: Good morning. Do you know any therapist in Maryland?\n",
            "Doctor: I do actually I know someone who is very good. And I also have a pretty big network of colleagues here who would he will know some people there?\n",
            "Patient: Okay, one of the funniest friends visited over the weekend her sister has just moved to Maryland and is struggling to find a therapist that works for her.\n",
            "Doctor: I know someone very good I've got but I've been in contact with him a couple years ago, but I can I bet you can you I can dig up his name. I thought he was very good when I spoke to him.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks, if it's not too much trouble.\n",
            "Doctor: It's fine.\n",
            "Patient: I think so. I feel like last week's session was very helpful. So I've asked if you could want me more and keep I really appreciate that. I feel much less. I was floundering.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: So thanks. I think you asked a question. Did I feel like I was floundering in my everyday life. I think I sort of said yes. Yes and know the answer is probably more. Yes, then no in some ways, but like this is an anchoring point in some sense. So helpful to be here and particular helpful last week. So, thanks. I think I also expressed that I felt anxious while we were talking. I didn't really have a reason as to why but after I left I think that because it's that I rely on the session that I was and sometimes am anxious. Like we won't get to something not that I have a particular thing. I need to get to but like the time is very precious to me. So I might waste it or something. So those are my summarize thoughts. We were talking at the end about what constitutes a good reason or bad reason for making relationship decisions. I thought maybe we could take that up again.\n",
            "Doctor: I'd be happy to do so.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks. It's sort of it occurs to me that I should probably talk out some of the features of last week. So it's my new friend Candice came to visit Candice was trying his roommate. I will even married very good friend. She's great. The one of the few people for who was always good for for who for Tanya. It's always good to visit. So it's helpful to have her it's good. She got in on Wednesday and then left Friday evening. So it's kind of a strange time. But she was on spring break from the teaching job. She works at So I think that the most save me a piece of that is that like I think there's two pieces of it that in terms of preparing for Candice to visit, you know, cleaning the apartment converting the room that we have a table and to a room that has a bed in there. So Candice could stay with us. I did all of that work. So particular, you know just how guess so maybe the more important things is Candace Scott in on Wednesday when Tony was at work and so Candice and I sat and talked for a while then her sister. I don't know if I knew this and had forgotten it but I think that I knew this her sister is bipolar and that was a real struggle with She had been diagnosed with that in high school for Candice. So it was interesting to talk with her some about how this affected funniest illness affect her and sort of for understanding of my position in them. I have the sense that I can express but not explain very well that like being able to walk or being able to talk with Candice and that way was something that is missing from my relationship with Tanya to a large extent. Not particular about those subjects, but those were part of the conversation. So that seems important.\n",
            "Doctor: when you say talk in that way, how do you\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's the right question. But I don't know how to answer it. Did you ever like sit and have coffee with someone for a couple of hours that I\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: you might like it and sort of talk about New Zealand or what you're thinking about and progressed through bad to talk about like what? Here's a whole conversation that has many different parts of describing experience you understand. That's another thing. I don't know how to articulate a better than that, but there's a sense of like scope and depth. Talk about many things and it doesn't have to stay shallow in any way. There are only intense moments of danger or some kind in the conversation.\n",
            "Doctor: And so with Tanya that feels like moments of danger.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I said it and I sort of saw you grab on to that one. I think you should and I understand why you would but yes.\n",
            "Doctor: But this isn't come they're not like intense moment of danger implying that.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I know. Yes. So there are certain topics that like set Tanya off. Or that's funny can't talk about those feel dangerous to me because I don't trust 28 to handle her emotions. So I guess I don't have trust that. It's going to be okay or like that. Candice and I were talking like I don't know that was I think a very hard time for her. Yeah. And so I was I said, well, you know where boxer there and some senses. But we're back in the hospital. This is Rita and some stones or feels like it and so it's sort of raise the question of like this ever going to go away. What is our future look like. And I think that was when she told me that her sister was bipolar and that like it had made her Search Wonder also whether this was a thing what that was going away or whether this was men and so we both sort of side with that moment and she was okay. I need to talk about something else. That's too much and so he did.\n",
            "Doctor: sitting with the\n",
            "Patient: No, no the last part that I need to talk about something else.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: Like this is going to be personally, can you move?\n",
            "Doctor: So modulating something or moderating.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yes. Yes. Protecting yourself also and expressing her needs at a time when they can be met still. Not same situation 21 on say anything until it was like until she was already overwhelmed by whatever negative feelings there were. That's not helpful to anyone. Not that it's expected to be overwhelmed by feelings, but that like\n",
            "Doctor: Seems like you're really a warrant on probation is interesting.\n",
            "Patient: so I think that's a larger part of what I mean about like intense moments of danger.\n",
            "Doctor: I think she can't take care of herself in that way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Then maybe at times going there is okay, but not be able to not go there at times when there are other things you need to do, you know, or just sort of function in your day. You've got to wrap it up and move on.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yes, and we supposed to situations where things like that are coming up or are going to come up like some sense of being able to drop her. Boundaries and say like I need to not go there right now before you've been there. So in couples counseling Monday, I can't remember exactly how the conversation evolves over time but it ended up talking about 20 of work at her church being about like taking care of people sometimes like going and she would go. Sorry and she would go to the morning service on Sunday sometimes and then like afterwards that was summer to visit. someone who couldn't make it to church Yes, and she talks about it in the context of like this is a thing that is normally very good for her but gets very very hard as she gets worse. Dr. Janice picks up on the it as a thing. Like this is a thing that helps you feel better which is true and the nice observation, but he also been like bra. That's why our relationship in the context that like maybe she would feel better. If she felt like she could take care of me which is definitely a saying that she says or believes or wants to do which eventually to me expressing The View that I I don't particularly trust her and that description of the issue. The one that you was giving sounds to me like you should let her take care of you as another thing. That you do not buy you do to make her feel better. Like you should extend some arbitrary amount of stress not because it's like because I will help her and I found it frustrating.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you share that with him?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yes. Yes, perhaps less the lightly than I would have liked.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you tell me how that frustrated you?\n",
            "Patient: Yes. I guess I started the summary off of the things that happened that week by saying that I did all the preparations for Candice to come visit that takes time in addition to like spending some time with Candice all weekend to sort of catch up on the things that I have. I have not done while I was doing those things. It's very frustrating to carry like I guess it's frustrating anytime. It's particularly frustrating. Contacts to hear like well if you just do a little more Tony will be better like if you know where yes, if you do a little more 20 would be better. Maybe that's true somewhere but I don't think that's the point at the end of the day. I think that the plant the end of the day is that when you can't take care of herself or can't always take care of her so I've certainly become frustrated talking about it. I'm not sure if I articulated why I'm frustrated but\n",
            "Doctor: Well, let me make a running analogy which may not be helpful to you. So but I'll give it a try. So what so and I was thinking well, you can tell me if this feels like part of the point. Maybe it's a little bit besides the point but the focus of couples therapy is different from the focus of individual therapy for a lot of reasons, but specifically it relates to someone relationship. The focus of individual for couples therapy is not either weather either partner wants to be in a relationship. The goal is to make the relationship the best the relationship they can be whether one wants to be in a relationship or not is a separate issue a very important issue but not really the focus of couples therapy is kind of like a personal trainer answered and said, I'm not really sure what I want to get into this race or you know, but But that's not the personal that's not that's that's a separate issue. You go to a personal trainer the personal trainer helps you get to that training for that race whether you actually want to take the stuff to do the race is a very important question, but it's not one you think you can talk about with a personal trainer. Does that make it's not a great analogy? It's actually a pretty good analogy, but that's sort of how I don't know if that address is some of the frustration that you're feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so let me make the analogy a little bit worse by stretching it more than it probably needs. So now turning to your personal trainer the coach and you're running a relay race and one of the one of your relay race Partners has a broken leg, but the coach is still trying to train you to win the race. I think more how it feels. Well, if you just run twice as fast like, you know, you guys will almost be as good as me where\n",
            "Doctor: Ashley a really I think that out analogy, I think that is at least that analogy that conveys to you what you're feeling.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like it was good at doing that. At least I'm glad that it works. So, you know, it's and part of the thing about feelings is that I don't think that's actually what he is doing and you know, I actually think he's very good and I'm glad that we got to him for the most part. But right now I'm very frustrated with this idea of like trying to make a relationship better when I'm back on yet is out of the crisis where she has hospitalized but she's still pretty bad like she's not doing well. So we go there in like we can't really talk. About trust. I mean we did because that was where the conversation went. And I didn't avoid it like I do sometimes but ends up in the place where I stay like, I don't trust here and why should I so which I feel like it's not particularly helpful to Tanya when she is, you know, struggling with her broken like\n",
            "Doctor: Well, but it's the truth.\n",
            "Patient: yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And I have to believe the truth is helpful somehow. I'm serious.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I wasn't laughing to dismiss that. Yes at the Viewpoint that I am committed to also but I don't always feel. So yesterday so Sonia like in the morning Tony will get up and then get ready for the day and then I'll get up around the same around the time that she leaves depending on when she leaves because she leaves at different times of day and so often it's the case that she'll she'll like come say goodbye as I'm still half-asleep. So yesterday she sort of said in a slightly peculiar way. Goodbye James, which she never really says my name when she is saying the but I don't know why I think and you know, so I was concerned for a portion of the day that she was going to kill herself. I think that expressed my feelings about the truth and dangerous or something to\n",
            "Doctor: the sounds Like such a simple statement and perhaps in a way, I don't mean it at all. But ultimately you need to decide what you want. And if you want this and part of the problem with this is it's not clear. What its this is is this how Tanya was going to be this is a very bad stage in her life that she will move on from at some point. Those are unknowns. And so that decision needs to be made with those are nuns because those are unknown it certainly seems like there's this is going to go on for some time. it's certainly not clear to me whether this is just going to be a lifelong illness that will basically have this course or whether she'll get better could really go either way and a that you have to think about whether those situations are okay, and if you ultimately want this\n",
            "Patient: You know that was strikingly direct. I appreciate it. Yes. I don't know how to make that decision with what you think, you know, so half of this is why would anyone want this? You know that all hinges on the meaning of want or the righty of different maybe hinges on this? I don't know yes or no other contacts. I have something like Siri responses to uncertainty. When is to formulate a test case. I will differentiate between possible outcomes that's not really icy. And no way to do that here when the large uncertainty is what's going to happen in the future that really becomes not a useful way of handling. The problem 1 is to reduce uncertainty see as much as possible and then leave the uncertainty uncertain But that usually goes hand-in-hand with the other one. So like here's a range of possible mechanism for a chemical reaction. We can rule out all but two of them. You can't decide between them but leave at least ruled out all the other ones. You did that sometime ago right you presented the main fold of world in which I would be okay and hens essentially two features on it. So And that was helpful in the short-term and that's not particularly helpful in like which of those will I need will I end up or should I end up on? And a third it's a sort of attempt to estimate the uncertainty. What about it and some way? I'm not sure that's actually feasible here either so I didn't see a real well beyond that just said something about uncertainty. I don't know what to do about that. Actually, I think there's a four thing to so in terms of like personal decisions. I think I will attempt to sort of observe other people making simple decisions and sort of monitor my reaction to them and sometimes that's helpful. It's the reason that I like well written TV shows actually\n",
            "Doctor: Well, maybe another way of looking at it sounds like it's missing a piece but that's sort of how Tanya will fare in the future. If you take that variable out and say is that doesn't matter that much. I mean I is this the marriage that you would want to be in now and they're there enough things about Tanya that you love and value and are there enough parts of your moral system that you feel committed to that. This is the marriage that you want to be in. And so just try to sort of assess well things go better the future of this will be worth it verse not maybe it's not as important. It seems important in some ways, but then I thought about more and I thought I don't know because I'm even if I mean you can sort of makes your argument and safe. I'm 5 years from now Tanya is doing better will 10 years from now. She might not be\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: so sort of tried to assess based off of your current investment could be very crude, you know later out come on a card investment. Maybe it's not a very good way to go.\n",
            "Patient: Yes. I did not clarifying. I was sort of sitting here thinking about so if I were to stay I why this marriage it's clear to me that I need to construct the rest of my life in such a way that is fulfilling in the ways that this marriage is not or else. I wouldn't be happy right because which is more or less exactly what you said many months ago. Yes. I was also thinking about I don't want this but I also think that those aren't and I don't want to walk away from that commitment that I made but if I hadn't made that commitment, I wish I would have my only reasons for not walking away. Would be concerns for Tanya's well-being in the short run. Like I actually don't want to hurt her. I do love her.\n",
            "Doctor: And if that's true that you will need to find a way to have that be more sustaining during these periods. Meaning, you know, your commitment to commit answer that being your kind of moral code and value system and sort of maintaining that adhering to that will help will need some sort of help you whether these more difficult. You know getting some satisfaction that you are hearing to that and other words. This shouldn't be the only reason not to leave but this it should be something that sustained you while you stay\n",
            "Patient: Yes. I hadn't thought about. That seems like an interesting topic for all. In terms of it's that important to me. Why don't I find it the same thing or something like that?\n",
            "Doctor: Experience is something that's confining and is limiting to your options. It's very different thing than something that you're practically committed chill and that you feel fulfilled you feel good about fulfilling.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I need to think about that a little bit more. I sort of feel like there are broader implications, but I can't pull them all out right now. And I also feel like it's a little bit my own thoughts on its on it are sort of distracting from the main point if that makes sense. Yes, I guess another way to describe it as I feel like there's a conflict between my You put it commitment work commitment to commitment and my desire to not be unhappy forever or not be unhappy. Right now and I guess there is some resolution to that conflict in while you're just saying I also don't know how to work out.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I'll see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Where do you want to start today?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure like things are getting better with Sidney like when we talked after the fight. So I think the problem I guess is my tone of voice when I'm mad at him and because like when we get into an argument, you know, and he says I'm yelling at him. I'm like, I'm not yelling. He's like, well you sound really upset.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And I'm like, I am really upset like I mean, I guess it's solution then is to figure out how to fix my tone of voice.\n",
            "Doctor: You hear what he's saying? Like do you can you hear in your voice what he's reacting to?\n",
            "Patient: Not always like I mean I used to think I sound mad but I don't think I sound like more mad that I am or really super duper mad. And I just don't know if it's like, you know part of me is like will I'm angry and I want you to know it but then again that's just hurting him. So I don't know. I told him well, why don't you record the next fight we have and then I can listen to my voice, but I don't know if that would like I guess I have to but I think the only way to change it is to like be more patient while being mad like it seems like the only way\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you finding a way to say that you're angry, but speaking calmly might make it easier for him to hear what you're really saying.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, because then he shuts down and it's like he's not listening to me and then he gets mad because I'm repeating myself. I'm like, but you're not listening to me you're shutting down and not letting me talk interrupting me. That's not really going to work.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. So you do want to find a way that you can have a conversation that you can both participate in if he's shutting down. He's not really participating.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And if he's shutting down because he finds a tone to overwhelming.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Then it's not really working for you either because you're not being able to express really what you want.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's just that then. I don't know what to do other than try to be calm when I'm not come in like a fight is happening. I'm very much not cam.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you delay the conversation until you are called?\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I mean last time it was in the context of trying to wake him up on Saturday morning and Friday night. He did staying where he likes it up late and then like\n",
            "Doctor: What does after I spoke to you Monday?\n",
            "Patient: Monday\n",
            "Doctor: The next Friday happened again.\n",
            "Patient: next Friday. Yeah, I'm like we had this conversation you promised you wouldn't you promised you take Ambien before you were, you know, trying to stay up late whatever because first you wanted to get a snack. He was like listening to some lecture when he got snack and then he like got up again until I shower and shave and he took the Ambien right before he showered and shaved as opposed to taking Ambien before he got the snack at like, you know, so he take Like 4 a.m. Or whatever instead of 2 a.m. Or something and like it was at least a two hour time difference. If not longer I think is going to win and he could have taken it but like, you know, he's acknowledged that he's like, you know, he's told me before that. He wouldn't do it again and he doesn't again is just like so frustrating. I'm like, why do you keep on doing this because he's like no being so immature like he doesn't want to face the day or whatever you want some alone time right now at like really late but then it like impacts our plans for the next day like things he promised. It's like really hard for me to deal with and so like, you know, it was in the context of trying to wake him up at morning and maybe I should have been nicer about it when I woke him up, but I was just so pissed that he wouldn't wake up. I had to wait like another two hours before I could do anything because like he needed more sleep, but you needed more sleep. It was his own fault.\n",
            "Doctor: What were your plans that day?\n",
            "Patient: Well one thing he promised me we'd actually make out because we had him for like weeks and because he was up for it on Friday night, but then he was too tired. And so he was like, I definitely want to tomorrow and then he was just like sleeping and I sort of knew that I mean granted. This is like a bunch of stuff. So like in the past when something like this has happened when I let him sleep in he's going to be hungry for lunch and not want to do anything and then after lunch help someone of eating too much I need time to digest in like, you know, we're not feel good and then nothing will ever happen and he'll change his mind and I have been weeks and I was kind of going crazy or at least a week at that and it in like a week and a half or two weeks. I just made me feel like his desire to watch like listen to those lectures that night at that point was more important than like being intimate with me.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that a feeling that you've shared with him?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it is and he feels pressure. But I'm like it's sort of hard not to like, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: It seems very honest.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like you know, it'd be one thing if I knew like going into this relationship that he had really low libido. But like when he's not depressed he doesn't and he's starting to get better. But then he had like a cold that like, you know, he's had for 3 weeks and said that making things hard even if he is getting better mentally like he's not better physically and\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it sounds like that's one component of it is not I mean heard it is feeling like there's not enough intimacy, but he's also not following through on other plans that you've made.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like he ended up being awake for New Year's Eve, but we didn't get to do anything romantic mostly because he was sick and said I was a disappointment. He was like, oh we can do something romantic later in the week. I was like, okay that never happened either. But again, I guess he keeps on thinking he'll feel better and then he doesn't so there's like nothing I can really do about that. At least I got him to go to the doctor and I did and he actually liked called and made an appointment. He called last Wednesday, then he had the appointment last Thursday and they did like a bunch of tests and he doesn't have mono or strep or anything, but he did because of its debilitating cost they give him inhaler to use if he's coughing too much and that's actually been helping so\n",
            "Doctor: Oh good.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm really glad he finally got over the whole not seeing the doctor thing. And then he's like should I go in for an actual check up? And I'm like, yes, you haven't had one in three years. So I sometimes we make progress but sometimes we still fight in like, you know, I was just so afraid on Saturday that like, you know, maybe we'll never be able to figure it out and like I don't know a good solution other than don't sad mad when I'm mad or like I have to keep everything in until I feel more calm which like I guess is a mature adult thing to do. But like I feel like then I don't actually get to Express Pipe and frustration.\n",
            "Doctor: well, I think there's you know, it's a part of it is the quantity of it in that. This is not these are not isolated event. They're not feeling like isolated events anymore.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So, you know, you have a right to express your anger. He also has a right to have your feelings expressed to him in a way that feels respectful and I don't know if that's what he's saying that it feels does the tone of your voice feel disrespectful to him. I don't know that's not a word that you used.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's not a word that he really use either. It was just more. He said you know that I keep on hurting him. So it's hurtful I guess which is even worse than disrespectful but\n",
            "Doctor: What feels hurtful about being angry?\n",
            "Patient: I guess he doesn't like when I'm angry at him and he thinks it you know, I mean, I don't like when people are angry at me. I guess the difference is it feels like\n",
            "Doctor: It feels like you have a right to be angry.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, so I don't know what to do and it's not like I'm taking out my frustrations on from something else on him.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: I'm taking my frustrations at him.\n",
            "Doctor: Right and you sort of you want him to take responsibility for the for the things that he's doing that result in you feeling angry.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and it just really bothers me. He says I'm sorry. I'm like, okay, you said that the last time to you know, and it's not I'm not yelling. I'm not raising my voice like I was\n",
            "Doctor: but the tone feels yelling because the tone feels\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: like you're reprimanding him.\n",
            "Patient: Which I am. Because I'm annoyed at him because he keeps on doing the same things over and over again while promising not while promising not to do then it's just like how do I trust you? If you don't ever follow through on your promises, which I guess it's in overgeneralization. It's not like she never follows through but\n",
            "Doctor: So you keep telling him that you're angry.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And he keeps saying I'm sorry. So which one of you is going to stop doing the same thing over and over?\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'm the only one who can because you know, and I told him before that like if he says he's sorry, that just makes me more angry. Because I don't believe him, you know, I think he just sorry that he did something that made me angry but not that like or that he whatever he did made me angry, but not that like that whatever. He did made me angry, but not like necessarily for whatever he did because he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong, but it's like impacting.\n",
            "Doctor: So does he not agree that what he's doing is detrimental to the relationship?\n",
            "Patient: I guess he doesn't he thinks that I'm being the detrimental one by getting mad.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh.\n",
            "Patient: I mean somewhat he I don't know I guess what the staying up late then he thinks he's an adult he's entitled to do that and like okay, but if you make promises from the next day and stuff, it's really frustrating and like he does admit sometimes that some of the stuff he does is self-destructive, especially because he's an insomniac I'm trying to fix that like you need to get a regular sleep schedule. If you're going to try to get out of her out of depression and but like, you know, so there's sometimes he thinks they're right and sometimes he doesn't think they're right and whereas I usually think I'm right because it's not an isolated incident. It's a chronic feeling of not mattering sometimes and yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's a really tough pattern that you guys are stuck in because you can't change his behavior.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And it seems like they're both of you. You don't really feel like neither one of you feels like you need to change what you're doing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You feel like your anger is appropriate and your expectations of him are appropriate and it sounds like for the most part he feels like what he's doing is appropriate as well.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so there's no way to fix it then, right?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you can't you can't fix him and you can't fix a pattern.\n",
            "Patient: but\n",
            "Doctor: You can't change a pattern by yourself. You can only change your response to it.\n",
            "Patient: I can try to respond more, but I don't think I'm going to get any less like mad about it. Like I have the right to be mad. He's like you can't be mad at me. Don't be mad at me and I'm like, you know, I'm allowed my emotions.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, you are.\n",
            "Patient: So all I can really do is just not respond right away and\n",
            "Doctor: Why can't you be mad at him? Can he explain why it's not okay for you to be mad.\n",
            "Patient: No, he said it's just that it's not okay to be mad about something. I'm like, I have the right to he doesn't say why you know, I guess maybe because he can't do anything wrong. But like I have the right to be upset, I guess maybe because me being mad hurts him but like he's doing things to make me mad.\n",
            "Doctor: His behavior really just disappoints you.\n",
            "Patient: And he was like asking about me and do I have problems with anger management? Like I don't I'm not yelling at him. I'm just in a pissed-off tone of voice because that's what I am and I'm not not calling him names. I'm not hitting him or throwing things or even raising my voice. But like it's just the tone of my voice.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is pretty honest it sounds like in reflecting what you really feel.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, and so I guess like what I have to be dishonest or\n",
            "Doctor: Well, if you want him to hear your message, it sounds like you need to be more in control of the tone of your voice and whether that's being able to take a deep breath and speak calmly even when you don't feel that way or let him know that you're too angry to talk right now and delay the conversation until some of that anger and disappointment has excited. If you want him to hear the words that you're actually saying it sounds like you do need to change your tone whether that's right or wrong isn't the question because if you too if you want to stay in a relationship with him and you want things to change the only piece you have control over is how you respond to the situation and it sounds like right now the response of letting him hear the anger that you feel is resulting in him not really being able to hear your message. She hears the tone and shuts down as he say So the peace that you have control over is you can change the tone and as I sit here and thinking about the two ways to do that are either to delay it until that anger has subsided or to find a way to take that seat breast and then speak in a way. That's more call. I'm not saying that you don't have a right to be angry or that it's not okay to express your anger. The reason I'm saying this is because he's not hearing you and you want him to hear you.\n",
            "Patient: it makes me a little annoyed that I have to do this in the first place and I can't just express my anger and then deal with it, but like\n",
            "Doctor: I can understand that you're taking on a lot of the responsibility.\n",
            "Patient: And it just feels like it's just like I feel sometimes like I'm the one doing everything.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that's part of why you feel so upset is because you do feel like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You feel like you're doing your fair share of getting this to work.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, you know things like taking care of him and making food and doing all these things that like, you know, when I was sick and he was panicking I was still do things for him. You know, I would still make him food and even when I was sick or like do crazy things like emptying the dishwasher at his place standing on a chair while dizzy, which I really should not have been doing and things like that, but when he's sick and I'm panicking because he's sick. I still have to do all these things even though in the river situation. I did all those things. Like I just I'm taking care of him a lot more than he's taking care of me and it's just really frustrating. So yeah, I can't really do anything though. Like, you know, like if I don't cook then we don't get food and you know, I don't want him to start but I don't want him to starve and I don't want me to starve so, you know all sorts of things that I just feel like I'm doing everything. I mean in reality, I guess I'm not doing everything. Sometimes he does things but I think I still think it's pretty unbalanced.\n",
            "Doctor: It feels a bit lopsided.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's not like I take down and write every time I cooked or he's cook dinner for me or stuff so I could be wrong about this, but I don't think I am.\n",
            "Doctor: That's certainly it's the story that I've been hearing in here for quite a while.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you know, I am only basing on what you say, but this is not inconsistent with things you said in the past you have felt that you've been taking one more of the responsibility in a relationship and more of the responsibility of caretaking for a long time.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and like he's been depressed for almost a year. Like that's a really long time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, it is.\n",
            "Patient: I mean it's not his fault because like he's at least it's not like he's been avoiding therapy and drugs or anything like that. He's he has appointments. He makes them he goes to them. I mean granted a lot of his therapy has been phone sessions because he's been feeling sick, but he still usually goes to his therapy twice a week, but it's\n",
            "Doctor: So he's doing some of the things that you expect of him and working through this but not all.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That's you know, one of the reasons his sleep bothers you so much is because that feels like something he could be doing to try to get better that he's not.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Doing consistently.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I guess more when it impacts my plans for the next day. So it is kind of selfish because if he needs to sleep in on another day and I don't need him for anything that I get that I'm not mad about it and I can let it go but when it impacts plans that we would be doing together and then I have to work around him because he stayed up all night is just really tiresome. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sorry that you guys are having such a hard time being happy together.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I think most of it's just stems from his his depression. That's like why I've been staying is because he can get better from that depression eventually he will and then he won't be like this anymore. I mean something's might still be the same but like he won't you know, the low libido won't be an issue anymore. And I mean, I guess I'll still be insomniacs, but if I can separate my plans from his I think me having a job would also help things a lot because then I would be getting out of the house and stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: You'd feel less dependent on him for your day.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, except I yeah, I'm still not up for the past 3 weeks. I have stuck with the one application a week.\n",
            "Doctor: You've gotten that in.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Good job.\n",
            "Patient: Except that I have been gone and I actually did get two emails from two different positions that I applied to that. I did not get the position.\n",
            "Doctor: But you don't you have control of the sending it in. Peace.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: So you're doing your job?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And the temp agency hasn't come through with anything yet.\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm going to call I mean they sent they said like skipped a week of Christmas and New Year's.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: So I'm going to call I don't know maybe tomorrow or something, but they've not come through with anything yet.\n",
            "Doctor: I will follow up and put it on your list that one of your jobs is to follow up with them tomorrow.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: and I think you know you can be proud of yourself for getting in your one application a week because that's more than you had been doing the weeks prior and I know it didn't result in the way you want it yet, but\n",
            "Patient: though my parents my mom seemed kind of skeptical when I told her I'm doing one application a week, but I'm like it's more than I was doing before. That's all I can do right now. So I almost have applied to two jobs last week. Like there were two that I could have applied to but the other one the website to apply for them was like so slow and broken. I was just like screw this and not spend and written a cover letter yet. So like I you know, so it wasn't like I spend on whatever only to not lie, but it was just you know, it's it's one thing to have a really application where you have to fill out the things and basically like replicate your resume and he asked you for your resume to but at the site won't even load that's my point of giving up because I don't want to sit and wait for 3 hours for website to load and wonder if the application even got in so I don't actually And then that one was posted on like the like archives listserv thing anyways, so a bunch of other archivist. We're also applying so I think it was the end of the world not to apply for it and it was it wasn't something that I was like really really excited about so I think yeah, I think slow websites counts as a like a legitimate reasons not quite something.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's your list. So.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I applied to something else that day. So I was so I still fulfill my one a week.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, let's keep going with that because that's working in to at least get you moving.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's not really working to get me past.\n",
            "Doctor: It hasn't gotten you a job yet.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and I guess my dad sent me to the email. It was like, oh give your resume to this person her husband might have might know things about a job, you know thinking about my dad. I was like what the hell like but I didn't say anything. All I did was read the person sent her my resume and told her like I'm his daughter blah blah blah and she said she would send it to her husband. I don't really know what kind of job like a lead on a job. Like, what does that in my field outside my field admin assistant thing retail. I don't know like he gave me absolutely no information and like and does this person even actually want me to send the resume, but I\n",
            "Doctor: But instead of engaging in an argument with your dad.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, I mean I could have sent it and then engagement arguing with my dad, but I didn't I just sent the resume and the woman was like oh, yes, I'll forward it to my husband and I haven't heard anything since\n",
            "Doctor: You weren't harmed in any way.\n",
            "Patient: other than being annoyed and my dad being like when he sends me stupid things that make no sense like internship internship that doesn't mention anything about being paid at like this Jewish girl school, which has absolutely has nothing to do with my field. Also, it's all the way out and nowhere and then like then I have to drive and it's I don't know like if an internship doesn't say it's paid and doesn't say it unpaid is the Assumption or is there not an assumption you can make\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like it's worth asking a question because I don't I wouldn't know which to pick.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, if something were in my field or remotely close to what I want to be doing it would be one thing but it's like when my mom sends me job. Sometimes they at least make sense, but my dad sends me jobs. They never make sense.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I mean, I think if there's if there's an internship that interests you and it's unclear about whether or not it's a paid position may be worth a phone call or an email.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: To find out if there is some sort of stipend or salary or something that goes along with it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But you know if you're not interested in doing the work and he wouldn't apply for it if it were a paid position.\n",
            "Patient: If something is a paid position don't you think it would be to their advantage be like this is a paid internship because you know more people would be likely to apply if it were paid and unpaid.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not willing to speculate.\n",
            "Patient: Like if I had a paid internship offer, I would be like here is this internship? It is paid with a stipend with x amount of money or something.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think people are locking the responses, right?\n",
            "Patient: true\n",
            "Doctor: In this job market the employer or the internship holder. It's not really at the burden of trying to get people to apply.\n",
            "Patient: But they might be trying to get good people to apply.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think it's worth your energy to debate it. Your goal is to get a job and you can spend a lot of energy trying to make an assessment or assumption about what the employer wants or has to offer.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But you don't really know unless you ask.\n",
            "Patient: And is it okay to send that sort of email to son?\n",
            "Doctor: Sure. I'm interested in this position. I noticed that there was no compensation mentioned is compensation available for this position.\n",
            "Patient: Haha. Yeah, I think that's compensation something listed a while ago. Like is it are you still taking application? So I guess it wouldn't be much different than that. But yeah, I don't know. Maybe I should stop it up to two week.\n",
            "Doctor: if you can\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What if we say one with a bonus for two how do you set up that incentive chart for yourself?\n",
            "Patient: Milk have not.\n",
            "Doctor: So that doing that would be one way maybe if there is two that are interesting maybe if you had some sort of incentive and a reward for yourself. You might be more likely to do it.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: So you see you having some of the same behavior that your boyfriend is having four different things.\n",
            "Patient: But my behavior affects him a lot less than his effects meat.\n",
            "Doctor: That is true.\n",
            "Patient: And I'm applying to one job per week.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, that is true.\n",
            "Patient: And I don't see part of me thinks that the incentive I guess because I'm just thinking maybe I don't deserve a trip if I don't have a job. So why set up a system if I'm you know why I get rewarded for, you know, writing an application a week or whatever if they don't actually result in me getting a job. Does that make sense?\n",
            "Doctor: Well the way I think about it is what's the goal of the reward the goal is not for you to go on a trip. The goal is to get you doing more things that benefit you and apply for jobs benefits you because it's the only way you're going to get a job. You're not going to get a job unless you apply we know that no one application guarantees you a job also because we don't know the outcome of any of them, but if you're not applying you're not getting a job.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So the goal is selling have to chart is that it gets you to do things that give you a chance at getting what you want.\n",
            "Patient: haha\n",
            "Doctor: Sausage shark gets you to apply two more things to not let things that are possibility slip by then. It's doing its job.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not a freaky trip.\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: but if setting that up for yourself, if setting up a certain number of applications and you get to go on a trip stops you from applying stops you from applying because you don't think you deserve a trip then that's not\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: That's not helping you either.\n",
            "Patient: true\n",
            "Doctor: We need to find something in that gets you to do something to help yourself.\n",
            "Patient: So far, all I can really do is just guilt myself and Hope.\n",
            "Doctor: Does that help because you felt really guilty for a long time sometimes motivates you sometimes I don't think it does.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe not. I mean I've I don't know it's just hard. I'm also like a little bit sick and not makes it hard to I guess just I don't know maybe the when there's something I want to do. Okay, I will just do this your job application first then do like I think more immediate.\n",
            "Doctor: Right works better for you.\n",
            "Patient: Works better than something in a long-term, but like I don't necessarily always have that there.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Like today where I wanted to dye yarn and like I did that after I sent out the application.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so maybe we could look for more things like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing I could theoretically do is like dedicate one day a week for like spending, you know, 8 hours of that day looking and applying for jobs. And one day we spent doing yarning stuff for my store like dying things like and then I'd only be working 2 days a week and the rest of the time I could do whatever and I would still be more than I was doing for either of those things. It's just that I sort of lack the discipline too, and I'm like, okay or I could just do the one job a week which seems like a lot less than that and\n",
            "Doctor: Is there anyone in your daily life that could help hold you accountable to something that you set up?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know like maybe Sydney couldn't Theory. I don't know if you would I could ask him but like some things also are location-based. Like I can only do I can only dye yarn if I'm at my place and not when I met his place.\n",
            "Doctor: But you can be at your place whenever you want.\n",
            "Patient: Sort of I mean yes or no, like I can borrow his car and just go there but like if we were like, oh, we're going to sleep at my place tonight then it's like oh I'm too sick to go over and then I'm like, okay fine. We stay at your place another night. And you know, it's a lot harder to motivate myself to go over to my place and I yarn then already buy it my place and then dye yarn because it's a whole like 15 minute drive to my place and I have to try back. I guess it's not that long of a drive but like it's still\n",
            "Doctor: It doesn't sound like a very long time music.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well, assuming not rush hour, but it's enough to stop me from just doing it. I mean that also could be the I mean I've gone to my place for a few hours and dyed yarn, so I don't know I could apply for jobs when I met his place and dye yarn when I'm at my place or something. But as of yet, I haven't gotten a good system to motivate myself. Other than the you know, I will five one job a week system which\n",
            "Doctor: Well that's been working the past couple weeks. So it sounds like sticking with that and not changing that but if you want to add something to it now that you've done it successfully a couple weeks in a row.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you can maybe add something to it, but I wouldn't take away something that's working.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but right now I'm like having trouble finding a job for to apply to this week.\n",
            "Doctor: This week. Well, it's Monday.\n",
            "Patient: It's Monday. That's true. But I usually try to get it done early in the week so I can enjoy the rest of the week. Yeah, I really don't know what else to do though. It's either that or or possibly maybe I could go back to volunteering.\n",
            "Doctor: You could do that a couple hours a week in addition to applying for a job.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's you I mean one of the things I heard you say earlier is maybe one thing that would help with Sydney is actually being having your day be a little less dependent on him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And I wonder if having you know is setting up some time to go to a place to go to separate from him that you're not Reliant upon him being up at a certain time for you to go to.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: If that might if I might actually feel good.\n",
            "Patient: It might and then I'll get out of the house in like at least be doing something.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you get out of the house. You see someone.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, not that I'm necessarily that productive, but that's okay.\n",
            "Doctor: But you get up and out.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's true.\n",
            "Doctor: And I think having a little bit of structure having a place to be even if it's volunteering is a wonderful thing to do.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, just don't want to volunteer forever.\n",
            "Doctor: No.\n",
            "Patient: Because I would drive me insane.\n",
            "Doctor: No, you don't want to only volunteer forever.\n",
            "Patient: like I could volunteer on top of a job depending on what that job is but\n",
            "Doctor: Right now volunteering wouldn't really getting in the way of something else you have time to do it.\n",
            "Patient: It's just annoying. I don't have something else to do because now it's been over a year that I've been unemployed and like I really didn't think I'd be unemployed this long.\n",
            "Doctor: It's longer than you expected.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like I really thought I'd find a job.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a long time.\n",
            "Patient: And I haven't in like that. I don't know the economy is getting better, but it's like right now only getting better in terms of like stock prices, which only really helps the people who have stocks and like that doesn't always translate into jobs.\n",
            "Doctor: And your field fields are moving differently and your field is one where it's not really being helped.\n",
            "Patient: I feel really stupid. Like maybe I shouldn't have gone into like Library science and archives. Maybe I should have completely changed my focus to something more practical that like actually had job, but the thing things that do have jobs are like, you know, I don't even know anything at this point. Any further education is only going to make me over qualified for things in my field and like I can't like start another bachelor's degree till I get a degree in computer science or something because I would be really expensive and I don't really like programming because I'm not very good at it. But like I don't know what else to do or like, you know, go get an associates degree because maybe that would make me better. I get an administrative assistant jobs who goes and gets an associate's degree after they've already on the Masters.\n",
            "Doctor: You seem like someone to logical threats to following.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know just like sending one job application a week isn't really working either. I need to think outside the box and do something crazy, but\n",
            "Doctor: I think thinking outside the box has a good idea but thinking about pursuing a different degree that you're not interested in seems like a little bit much of an investment.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, just wondering if well, I don't know. I just also don't think I'm unless it was a Ph.D program that had a stipend. I don't think I could justify going for another degree because they would cost money. Even if there was something that would like, you know, if I want to get a museum studies degree as well that would cost money and I've used up all the money in my college fund at this point. So I'm not entitled to any more degrees so Unless I got a PhD in museum curator ship and that which case that would help me for another four or five years and then come out and have even possibly a tougher time finding a job. I don't know. It's like really unfortunate. I just feel so trapped because all I can really do is send out job applications and it's not really doing anything and I'm stuck.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you can send out job applications, which you're doing some.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And you can do the dreaded networking thing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, everytime. I try to think it true. I can't think of anyone. That would be a good person to talk to. I know people working place with the exception of you know, I know people who are working at libraries and that is great except that because the system is so centralized that they had the same HR department like doing interviews for all of our University like a mic having been told when I was working at 1 department and asked about it if like I was to apply to somewhere at the University, you know, when knowing that help and they say they don't get to see the applications or anything until it's like whatever stage, you know, maybe like the last round of interviews or something or at least, you know, it would be after initial interviews definitely not like so they wouldn't necessarily be able to pull my name from the pile unless I somehow I guess if I knew someone who is friends with someone who was in the HR department at the school. I think that would be the only way I don't know anyone who is friends with people in HR and I don't really know the people in HR and they like to keep all that information top secret and stuff. So the networking thing I think you know, yeah, I don't know people who work in other libraries that I'd want to work in or yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know that the people that you know in libraries don't know people in the field that don't work at the same libraries.\n",
            "Patient: That might I don't know. It's also been a while since I'd like to talk to any of the people, you know, and really the only people at is the Divinity School library. That was because I you know volunteer, I guess also the that we gave to her.\n",
            "Doctor: so\n",
            "Patient: If I see a job there I can like talk to the people, but it's like until I see that job.\n",
            "Doctor: What's so generally when people think of networking and they think about the first step not knowing where the other steps are going to lead. That's where networking is right. It's one piece leading to the next piece which leads to the next piece and not knowing where those pieces are going with the hope that something will lead to something productive and you're jumping a couple steps ahead. You're jumping to well. I know this person, but they can't do this very one specific thing for me to get a job at the school. And when you think about networking when you really want to think about is a branch of networks that are all interconnected and you don't know which one goes where you start with the one piece, you know and ask them to cast a wide net and then you hope that someone in that net if they don't have something that works for you they cast a wide net and that's what networking is its connecting people from different places to the mutual benefit of those two people that end up connecting in a new network and you're when you think about it, you're daunted by the fact that you don't see exactly how it might work. But that's really what networking is.

And I think it's sort of hard to sell his parents that I took them out yesterday and he's going really well, but I think he's very anxious. You know telling me about it, like ritualizing thing like brushes his teeth five times washes his hands five times and everything five times. Well, you know, I'm not sure you need to do it like 5 times. I sort of passed the information along to his parents of if it concerns them.\n",
            "Doctor: Want some random advice on the bike riding thing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that'd be great.\n",
            "Doctor: Return to learn much better. I mean Training Wheels. I mean not to actually teach them to ride without training wheel, but what actually does is a balance bike thing.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he's graduating up from like a balance bike thing to a training wheel bike.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so instead try like if it's easy to get the pedals off the razor bike. So get the pedals and the training wheels off but the seat a little lower and then the regular bike is like a balance bike and they skipped longer and longer and on that and it's much shorter steps to actually being able to ride the bike actually like doing the training wheel bike doesn't have anything to do with better balance.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks.\n",
            "Doctor: So whatever.\n",
            "Patient: El Paso on\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Good, of course now Jackson was really excited to leave Selena's balance bike. And now she just wants to ride the other bike the one he actually has.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: cool\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I never see them Balance Bike before but it's a new thing.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it's a new thing. I haven't an actual balance bike to be honest, but like the balance bike principles the bike store was going on about it.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thanks. Has decided she will never sleep again. Like life is way too interesting to be asleep.\n",
            "Doctor: Lucky you.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I mean in practice. It means I get to keep her up until she's cranky enough that she falls asleep faster, but she's like just go into the room with the crib. She's like, oh no. This is not going to happen lucky me. She said that she doesn't like she won't sit still long enough for you to change your diaper. So you just have to come up like Russell with her while you're trying to change her diaper. I'm not sure how I feel about James leaving, but it'll be nice to have time alone. I don't want to leave James I've decided what I'm going to wear in my cousin's wedding. I don't want to go it's expensive. My aunt would be really sad if I missed it. But it's just another how reasonable is it for me to need to go do this and the incense to ask James to go with me. This is my cousin who is like I mean, like I want to say this is my cousin. From my aunt and uncle who are nuts but it's like two-thirds of them at least so these are for cars Matt karizmatik people I've ever met like very very talented and very sort of nuts ways. So Lillian the one who's getting married the same age as my sister by like 4 days, I think both Amanda and I have always been like kind of jealous of them, but she's like not so much that they got their shit together because they really don't but they really don't seem bothered by it at all. It's funny watching Amanda and Lillian both of them when they walk into the room are instantly the center or focus of the room. It's just how they work. I think Amanda sees that that in Lillian but doesn't see that in herself entertaining because there's a lot of people who usually When they talk into the room are the focus of the room, sometimes that ends up going badly, but usually it's just really good. I have not met Williams fiance. Their father is a minister and their mom worked in Portland Public School for a long time. I think she was like an education specialist shoe was that like we sort of realize that when we got older but whatever. My dad doesn't know what to do with his kids. He calls her and she gives him a bye. So for years quite recently he told us he got The divorcee called Philip in and or Philip and she was like you need.\n",
            "Doctor: Like her name is Billa.\n",
            "Patient: Her name is Philip. Yeah, which is a family name.\n",
            "Doctor: haha\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, we name both girls and boys fell upon our family is very confusing for some people actually know we didn't used to but my aunt felt was pretty involved in the women's movement in the 70s. So when her older brother my uncle had a second child, he named himself after her so I'm not sure if it was a tribute or making fun of her it was probably both but she called her and she said you need a housekeeper and you need a nanny like this is what you need to do. Like here's how you're going to deal with your life wife leaving you so she's like the greatest person which I think she always seems she always thinks she knows what to do always takes charge. She had a daughter Kelly who died before Like that was her first child. So before any of us were born I didn't actually find out about her until my grandfather died.\n",
            "Doctor: How old was she when she died?\n",
            "Patient: Listen to hear that's how I found out about her. I don't think anybody was like nobody was keeping it a secret. It was just like nobody talks about her or at least my dad never talked about it. We didn't see these cousins that often and I found out about it because we she's buried at the same church that my grandfather grandparents are buried at it was clearly like so present and so real fur fill up and for and Wyatt, I hadn't known about it, and it was clearly really to all the aunts and uncles as well. I didn't know.\n",
            "Doctor: where is such a storytelling family and We tell pretty hard story as you know stories with a lot of bite, but nobody ever told stories about this girl.\n",
            "Patient: Nobody's named Kelly which there like 9? Ulysses 7 Linens and a whole bunch of Phillips. I guess male names when you get taxed on more tightly than female names. And of course feeling embarrassed or ashamed I didn't even know who Kelly was it like I asked him made dad and made dad kind of like what's wrong with you. Nobody told me. I haven't talked to him about session us filing claims. It seems like not a good time trying to pack and trying to get ends tied up and trying to set up like a work to do when he gets there. I feel like I'm getting what do I mean getting? I feel like I'm much more timid around him. Then that's good for me or has been done for a relationship. You know, certainly I've been timid with lots of people. second offer Disappointment I think the hardest part for Jackson is that he's not found. He's not quite strong enough to act Ashley turn the pedals when he not going very fast, you sort of afraid to go fast enough to get momentum Soho starts to go and then we'll start going and then stop and get frustrated because of pedals are right and he can't push them down. The pedals don't seem to be working. Well that well. When I was nine or 10 somebody took a picture of me riding a bicycle and reading at the same time.\n",
            "Doctor: It became a sort of iconic for me. Like that was what people remember about me for years. I really like to ride my bike by myself. I really like to read didn't like putting down my book for anything. It was like in a parking lot.\n",
            "Patient: Add the same thing happening to me what books I always used to I'd like to share a novel and I just wouldn't be able to stop until I finish the book like I don't care about anything else. Like I just want to finish a book. I just want to keep reading. I mean I read fast which is good, but it's a little bit scary to get enough caught in a narrative like in some ways nothing else in my life matters.\n",
            "Doctor: What's distract you in a way that recaptcha lights?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. The problem is that eventually you have to put the book down. Not that I haven't tried and then I feel bad just the day being gone. I had these things I was planning on doing today.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess there's also about not being with James because of feeling so sad that but I guess I also imagine that that wasn't the only thing that kept you apart.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. He sort of asked why I'm sad. He asked about it. I'm not going to tell him I'd rather be dead. I feel like he's taking care of me in so many ways that he wants from me or that he needs for me is for me to be okay, and I can't get them up.\n",
            "Doctor: So my impulse is to try to cover that up and I act like I'm okay and then I get distant from him.\n",
            "Patient: And then I feel like I'm help a lot. Things are hard copy. Yeah, I serve gone it through my head that this is the best way I can take care of him is to take care of myself, but then I can't take care of myself. I can't be okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I guess you felt sort of the same thing and it's part of where we ended yesterday about talking with me about wanting to be dead and I must see it differently, but if maybe not for quite the same reasons, I think it's James you feel like I am in the position of seeing you kind of on your own with that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but maybe not for quite the same reasons. They seem like there's a similarity there, you know, like both of you make me be alive and that's something a part of me can really get behind and is really committed and part of me and can't\n",
            "Doctor: Feels like there is an estrangement there and it feels like an estrangement to myself to are you in strange from yourself to?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah in the sense of like I'm committed to being but what I'm trying to do a large chunk of me doesn't want to do that. I can't you know that sort of something I can take out and look at and then I have to put it away like I have to spend not too much time with it. But when I don't spend any time with it, I beginning to feel like nothing I do is authentic.\n",
            "Doctor: I think you at least with me like set up the estrangement. I know what you mean yesterday my commitment giving me a lot of responsibility, I guess to do that. But at the same time we both know that I have very limited ability to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: another way that requires on your participation and I guess I have the impression that there is some way then you kind of setup of it or experience it as an estrangement. Whereas you probably in part because it's so hard and so scary to talk about any of the really really awful dark sometimes self-destructive. Sometimes I think that you feel I think I think you're so worried and sometimes I or nobody else can bear to hear it. Then more will want to shove them back on you in some way or another, you know, like with having somebody die, you know, you didn't get to have the moment of discovering that we're figuring that out or like the horror of it or sadness or whatever. Like you very quickly made it about somehow being your fault for not knowing or your responsibility to deal with it or something like that. I think this is a real similar with some of the things like people can't hear those. I mean, it's not clear with James now and there are some ways he can or their limitations which are which are there? I mean that's not just you but I guess it seems like with me I also sort of anticipate that and even arranged it a little bit.\n",
            "Patient: Have a very clear and focused very clear in my head. But like this is the place that I can cry when I need to but not for longer than 5 minutes.\n",
            "Doctor: Like the 10-minute like the minutes are like those are mine or if that's mine.\n",
            "Patient: I guess so, I guess I feel like it feels to me and I think that this is more me than you feels like to me as though the limits you have with you. I can tell you about the self terrible self-destructive things and feelings, but my attitude towards them has to be of one wanting to be better.\n",
            "Doctor: I think that. I think I can sort of with you makes me neglectful and a seemingly benign well-intentioned like like make me seem benign and well-intentioned but actually neglectful, which I think you.\n",
            "Patient: how neglectful\n",
            "Doctor: Because it puts limits on how you feel how things actually are for you.\n",
            "Patient: okay.\n",
            "Doctor: On the basis of how I what I think that you should be like it doesn't make room for you. Does that make sense?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: inside a cast in a positive way, which I do so often do it people or change the subject or said something like or said something and they meant be nice or they thought they were being helpful or I could see why they said it that way but really and left me alone and feeling worse. We're going to stop.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Friday at 4:45\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Thanks for drive safe.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, come on in.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I'm late.\n",
            "Doctor: Come in. You know what? I realized one quick matter on housekeeping so next week I give out statements.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: So we still haven't decided on what the fee was I was starting to make up the statement.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: We still haven't talked about that.\n",
            "Patient: I thought 85\n",
            "Doctor: That's fine. Normally I think I had said that I normally when people are working that's fine. We're meeting twice a week. And so I understand that's pretty costly 85 will be more than fine.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, and then you'll just send the bill.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'll email it to you.\n",
            "Patient: OU email it to me\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: And then I can just bring you in a check.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. Yeah. I usually just ask people to pay within a couple of weeks of state of the statements.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so it should work out fine.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: I feel like I haven't seen you in so long.\n",
            "Doctor: We didn't see each other on Monday.\n",
            "Patient: Noel which reminds me this coming Monday I'm going to be at in Ohio and like I won't be back in time, so I just don't want to like take a chance of missing and not being able to be here. So I'll just come next Thursday.\n",
            "Doctor: Next Thursday, okay.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. It's been kind of a long week. I'm trying to think so we went to court last week.\n",
            "Doctor: I haven't seen you since then.\n",
            "Patient: Madonna Rain on the charges and then the trial starts on March 22nd. So hopefully between now and then we can I guess the goal is to be able to get the charges dismissed. So hopefully but we will see Kevin was here all weekend and he was pretty attached on Friday 12 Thursday night, and I thought okay. Well that seems pretty normal because we're going to court and then after we serve talked and then he kind of just sort of like disappeared almost she was there physically, but just sort of went away and eventually I guess it was early Saturday morning. We were talking and I think he just is really nervous about everything going on. And it keeps saying like he doesn't really know if we're going to be able to it. I guess make things work and he keeps saying that he's trying to sort of keep everything that's happening lately separate not really integrate our relationship into all that stuff. But I'm not sure I'm all I'm feeling a little confused as to what he wants and I don't even think he probably really knows right now because he'll be really distant and then he says like I don't want to fall back into a pattern that we had before I want I want, you know to start over and make things, you know better on one hand. And then on the other hand, you know like Saturday and Sunday, we are together. We went out and we had a good time and we were talking and it was sort of not completely back to normal but in a way it was So I feel like how do we keep things separate and not really fall back into a pattern like start over but he keeps saying like, oh, we can't start over until you know, after all the legal stuff is taken care of and I'm just like so I don't even know what is happening right now and he keeps saying like he wants to still see me in like travel back and forth and all these other stuff. So I'm sort of just confused as to what he I guess what his feelings are about everything. And I know that he you know. Falling back into a pattern if you know not talking and not being able to communicate correctly and fighting is definitely not where we want to go. But at the same time it's like if you're trying to keep it separate and then you want to start over or should we be seeing each other now, but he doesn't want to break up. So I'm sort of just like going with it at the moment. And not really sure which new I mean, I tried talking him to stop but he just keep saying I don't know. And I guess you know, he doesn't know maybe he just needs some time to sort of figure that out I guess and he's trying to I think he's just trying really hard to not fall back into pattern what we did before. and so his way of doing this is whatever he's doing right now. I don't know but I'm supposed to be going there this weekend I leave tonight and you know, I was feeling nervous because I didn't really want the weekend to kind of go how last weekend went where he was just completely detached and almost didn't even talk to me for all all of you know, most of Friday. It was just very awkward and he is I felt really uncomfortable about it. And I sort of just said, you know, I just don't really want to keep that to keep happening if that's how it's going to be every time we see each other. You know, maybe it's better if we just push back and we don't really spend too much time together. So he said he's nervous about this weekend. But he also said like every time we get nervous we can't just be scared and not do anything like we talked about it or something then maybe it will make it a little bit better.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know why he wants to keep sort of the legal, you know, what's going legally from other things in your relationship?\n",
            "Patient: I think it feels like I guess what happened. He just keeps saying that doesn't happen in most relationships. Most people don't have this happen. Like this doesn't happen all the time. Like what kind of relationship is this if this is happening, is it even a good relationship? And I guess he's like, I can't focus on pushing back on putting back together a relationship until I can focus on until everything until after I've done focusing on dealing with the whole legal stuff. But now that the arraignment over we sort of have two months where we're just kind of Sitting In Limbo. I mean we can't do anything. We'll talk to our lawyers when we have to but there's not really a whole lot that we can really do and I don't want to thank that like we're just wasting the next two months sort of not moving forward and not really doing anything. You know, I'm coming here and you know, hopefully working stuff out and I was kind of hoping that it would all just sort of coincide. You know like after it happened then yes, okay, we're going to fix it and we're sort of going to move on and as we go and you know, if she wants to start over which in my opinion, I don't think you can really completely start over. Once you sort of have a history someone you can't just start from the very beginning. I mean you can go back and start fixing things that went wrong. But in my mind it's sort of like why isn't that happening now? Like why aren't we fixing it now and working only have communicate and all that other stuff now like what's the point of waiting until later on?\n",
            "Doctor: What sounds like he's really scared about the implications of this happening in your relationship, and he doesn't know what to do with it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he's really nervous about having to tell his job and how that could affect, you know, basically how it's all going to affect his career and stuff like that down the line. So I think he's really having a hard time sort of focusing on our relationship right now in like fixing it because he's too concerned about what's going to happen with his career and I think once you know that gets figure it out, then he'll be able to focus better. So, you know I said to him we agreed that we're going to stay together and work through this together. So it's going to take a little time. It's obviously going to take a little time, you know, nothing is ever going to change overnight or not. Just all of a sudden going to become different people and everything is going to work out. but I don't want to start of being the be in limbo in this relationship for a long. Of time, you know, like if March 22nd comes and then we have to go back to court again in two or three months like it is just dragging this out and I right now we're not doing anything to fix our relationship and you know, I know that I need to work on myself personally, but I can do that without being in limbo and serving this weird gray area having a relationship with him because he just I don't even know it like those things like you are always say that he misses me, you know. and I said something to him about it and he's like, well, it's not that I don't but it's sort of my way of keeping things separate feel like you will say it or he will say that he loves me and then he won't it's becoming very Hit or Miss I guess. So in like, I don't know what to say to him sometimes like it's appropriate like what's appropriate to talk about or anything like that? And I guess it's time goes on. It will sort of be a little bit easier. But right now it's just very awkward sort of a situation.\n",
            "Doctor: Movie says, you know this isn't normal. This doesn't happen in most relationships. How do you feel?\n",
            "Patient: I understand. I know that it doesn't and when it does it's something something probably has to happen. But the same time I've tried to say to him. I think it happens. I know it happens a lot more than people think. I know that when it's happening to you is to end of the world. And you know, it's really bad, but you know, I try to think like well. This is not like an isolated. You know, it's not like it's never happened before in the entire world. Like we're the only people that this is happened to we can't move on from this. and you know, so I feel like well, it happened. We're fixing it. So it sucks that it had to happen something so dramatic and so bad for us to finally like the light bulb to go off. But the same time, you know if we're going to stick through it. Then we should probably sort of working on something and I said to him last week. I also go to court and I'm not going to press charges and I'm not going to do anything and we can just sort of not seeing each other and just work on ourselves and revisit the situation at another time and he sort of got us up and he's like are you breaking up with me? You know, what are you saying in like? Well, no, but if that would make it easier for you because he seems to be the only one that struggling with keeping it to separate things. I feel like we should be working on it now, but he doesn't see it that way. Sort sort of we have differences of opinion, but you know, I'm not the only one who's facing legal charges either. I mean maybe if I was and you know, The positions are flipped. I may feel the same way as he like. I can't focus on anything else, but you know whether or not I'm going to have my career that I've worked almost 20 years on and you know all this other stuff. So I'm trying to see it from his point of view and you know, if you are so pathetic then I guess I'm pathetic and taking on his pain and depression. Is it like that?\n",
            "Doctor: Is he feeling depressed now?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he said this morning he feels like he's wakes up depressed and just kind of you know goes about his day and isn't really overly excited by anything when we were talking I said, you know, I usually ask him like how he's feeling and he just says, you know, okay and you know, he's like good isn't really an option right now, but I'm okay I guess but he said this morning he just feeling tired and he's like, I feel like I'm just waking up emotionally drained every day, and that's probably why I'm so tired all the time. It could very very well could be so I'm hoping that he finds a therapist or something. To see down there to just talk instead of get whatever he's feeling off his chest because he's definitely holding on to a lot.\n",
            "Doctor: Does he want to see a therapist down there?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he keep saying he does but then I feel like sometimes by the time he gets home from work needs to I don't know I guess depressed to feel like looking for someone and I don't want to push it but the same time, you know, I keep asking him like you really need to do something. You really need to go. See someone soon needs like I know I know I know and I can't do it work because they walk all the websites. I have to do it when I get home and blah blah blah blah blah, so I don't know if he's making excuses or not, but I keep asking him, you know, like and saying you really need to go you really need to go and he says he wants to But a matter of actually going I guess. feeling a little uneasy about the situation and then my mom, of course she says It's always something else with her. Thursday night. She texted me and said I don't even know what something about I hope everything goes. Well tomorrow and then Friday morning. She texted me or Saturday morning. She texted me and said I hope everything went well yesterday and then Sunday she check she texted me because she was dropping off my goddaughters gift and she said, you know, I'm going to drop off Madison's gifts. What do you want me to say and I said, well, you don't really have to say anything or do you have to drop off the gifts? And she said oh, well, you won't be home for a while. So I'll just do it and we're going that way so she dropped them off and then my friend who is no longer talking to me because I didn't make it down for my goddaughters 3rd birthday party, and then she stopped talking to me. So it was her birthday present from November and her Christmas present. Just text me and said, you know, thank you. I got the gift. And then my mom texted me again on Monday, so she's like reaching out. But she said, oh I'm going to send a box of stuff that you left here and some stuff that Duffy had left the dog. And I thought maybe you would want them and then I'll send back your suitcase of clothes which was which is like a huge 50 lb suitcase of clothes and she said I think you'll probably need them since you won't be back for a while and I just texted her, you know, thanks for sending the box and you know, you don't need to send the suitcase. I'll come and get it at some point and she just said no problem and I think it in there it was, you know, I really miss you or whatever. But I don't know if you sort of feeling like. I don't know how she's feeling and I know obviously she's trying to reach out but I still feel like I should be standing in a putting my foot down and not like I'm apologizing to her. You know, she can text me and say whatever she wants but that's not good going to change the fact that she hasn't been supportive at all and she can't be and that I don't feel like I can talk to her and you know in the past she's tried to stay to say things and be nice and sort of. Giving in and went back to you know, it's just it's sort of just went back to the way it was before and then she just keeps doing all the same thing. And I don't know and I don't want to give in and I don't want to just ignore the fact that she's been doing all the stuff. Whether she checked she text me or it says and says how much she misses me or whatever. You know, I'm sure she does and that's fine. But the same time it's like a she really misses me. Then why can't you pick up the phone and call to she always just text messages and sends me messages if it mattered that much to hurt him. Why don't then why wouldn't she just pick up the phone and call and leave a voicemail if I don't answer or just take that chance and said she she just sends me a text message because it's easier. I feel like yeah, she's trying to be nice, but it's also sort of just a cop-out because she's just texting. You know, if she ate sincerely cared about wanting to change stuff that I feel like she should be calling me and making a probe laughter and not just sending a text message. It's much easier to do that rather than actually call somebody.\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like both with your mom and your boyfriend there are similar frustrations, but their actions are not cord coordinating on concurrent with what they're saying.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and so I feel like confused and just sort of I don't really know how I should be acting. and what I should be doing and I definitely with my mom at least, you know, I feel a little bit more like I know which where I want to go with her and then I don't want to go back into having the same crazy relationship and the yelling and the drama and you know, I've already made that decision. And it's sort of a hard decision to make but I can't continue to let her control my life and you know blow everything up when you know, I need her during important times. And so I think as hard as it may be she as she keep sort of text messaging me or whatever. I just have to I guess stay strong and not sort of just let her back in like I normally would do. But you know with my boyfriend, I don't know like I want to work on the things and I want to make them better. But I just what he says and what he does or sometimes two, totally different things and then I'm not sure what I should be doing. and is becoming a little frustrating and you know, I don't know like I even when I try to talk to him is sort of He just says the same thing all the time about trying to keep things separate and all that. But I don't know if I need to sort of dig a little deeper and just say like I'm not sure if the skies is if this is going to work or I'm not sure if the says, you know, the sort of approach is okay for the time being, you know. It's not going to like if he doesn't know he doesn't think or he doesn't know I guess. Is what he's saying, you know if he can get over everything that's happened. That's fine. But I feel like he's also not trying to figure out figure that out right now. You sort of just being a depressant sort of wallowing in his own self-pity which for certain. Of time I guess everyone's allowed to do that. But at some point he needs to kind of do something about it make an effort on his part to sort of figure out his feelings and what he wants and all that stuff because I care about him and I love him but I can't wait around forever to figure it out, you know, if this is going to work out or not, so it's sort of frustrating. I just kind of wanted to do something but I don't want to be pushy and you know, I guess everyone has to do it in their own time, you know, I know years ago that I probably should have been here in this room and I just never did so I can't, you know point fingers at him and say like you need to start doing something when it took me years before I finally decided that I needed come. I just don't like being in the story of limbo.\n",
            "Doctor: What sounded like what happened scared him and it's simply didn't scare him in terms of you know, possible impact of this future. But as you said he was scared that he was capable of that. He saw something in him that scared him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he says I just didn't know that I had such anger in such feelings inside of me. And he thought that he had sort of given that he had sort of gotten over them. And I think that we've had a few conversations worried. I sort of look back and said, you know, oh, well there were some red flags over the years that you know, I'm now seeing and maybe have indicated that I didn't quite get over everything that happened before and you know, I should have done something about it. But yeah, I guess saw after such a long. Of time that he was just bitter and not really, you know over things. But you know now I think he realizes that he wasn't. And the fact that he still feels that way as sort of a gift scary to him.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, what happened before before when?\n",
            "Patient: So I guess it was six maybe seven years ago. He dated a girl when he was living in Maine and she apparently was very interesting and very kind of controlling and didn't you know, I always felt like he was doing something and he was going to hurt her emotionally. And where she would make him open up his email and she would read his email and she would even read through his text messages. And if he mentioned another woman whether she was married single you were really well or didn't know she would freak out and just you know, he's like, I feel like she's just emotionally abused. And there was a lot of different, you know, she said a lot of things to him that were nasty and mean and condescending telling him that he was in a terrible person and all kinds of stuff. And he's like she used to take all kinds of like I think she was on anti-anxiety medication. He said she was taking Xanax and all kinds of stuff and then she would go off of it and she'd go back on it. And then I think they were just a lot of emotional turmoil that happened and I think it was only like 2 years or two and a half years that they were together and eventually he said he was just taking it and taking it and taking and he thought he could help her to fix and fix her and you know, it came to the point where he just couldn't do it anymore like kicked her out, but I don't think he ever really got over the whole situation. Does he still sort of talks about her in a very bitter way and how she, you know did so many things in him and all that stuff. So I kind of know it seemed to me at first like you really wasn't over it, but I didn't realize that it was as bad as it was and he has so much anger and he didn't realize it either. So I guess realizing it as a positive thing and now he's sort of needs to get some help. Needs to get some sort of help with you know, dealing with all of the emotions and feelings that he has sort of. There are related to that so that you know, I guess it doesn't come up again. I think part of him is scared. Like what if it happens again? What it's the same thing happens between him and I that happened a month ago. What if we think everything is fine, and then it happens and I'm like, well, you can't really live in a motive. What-ifs because you can just going to think what if it's going to happen again and then what if what that's what it is, then you're never going to do anything. You're just continuously going. To be sort of scared about everything how everything happens and you know. You sort of take that chance, but you realize you know, I sort a few things and I guess help your own mental status and get your own feelings out. So it doesn't happen again. So, you know. It's not to say who knows. We didn't know it was going to happen it all the first time. You know where? So we're doing everything we can to try and make sure that it doesn't happen again. You don't normally expect that if it's not something that you can predict and say like this is going to happen today.\n",
            "Doctor: Except you don't feel like he's doing everything you can.\n",
            "Patient: I don't I don't I feel like he really needs somebody to see somebody about it and I sort of felt that way. She has a really bad back. So when he was younger, he was working for a company or something before we went in the military in a refrigerated her going on his back. So we just was in constant pain all the time. And he doesn't want to take any medication for it and he knows all this stuff but you know in the military if he does go to the doctors too much and they say that he has to have spinal fusion or something like that. Then he has to I have a waiver and it's kind of and it kind of messes with his career a little bit. So he's always been nervous to do something but he's always complaining like my back hurts my back hurts and back hurts hurts into me and I'm like, well if it hurts so much then go to the doctor or go somewhere and you know, like do the stretches that you were given to do by your physical therapist or by your doctor from before or go see a different doctor see if you can get the injections are like do something instead of just continuously complaining about it. And I said something start is In trying to be nice about it, but you know trying to be a little bit firm. and a few months ago and it started resulted in an argument where you know, he was like he was upset because I was being is not really mean but not necessarily supported or whatever and I was like, but you're always complaining and you're never doing anything about it and it's frustrating when someone on the other end and all they hear you do is complain, you know, I can see you in pain in your visibly like you can't walk sometimes but You're not really doing anything or trying to help sorcerer. You like the same thing. Why are you saying that he used to do something and he doesn't want it to be this way, but he's not really doing anything right now. It's sort of frustrating me.\n",
            "Doctor: because he\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's just like he complains about stuff, but then he doesn't do anything to like change it. So I'm just like, you know, if you want to pick something then he should probably put some effort into making some serve change no matter what you have to do. So I kind of gave up on asking questions or give you know about us back. It was sort of like I just stop asking questions or stop asking what he could do because he said he just felt like I was being to badgering. but I was in my opinion I just feel like I was just asking him questions. Like what what can you do? Where can you go? You know, what are your options? And he's like, I just feel like you're being pushy and I was like, okay, I'm sorry, so I haven't really press will going to see a therapist subject the moment but every once in a while I kind of made a comment about it and you know, he's like, I know I know I know but sort of says the same thing about his back so it's going to be coming frustrating. I don't want to just ignore it. But I guess he just needs to do it on his own time or whatever. He wants. I mean, I don't like being told what to do either. But sometimes I feel like I don't really complain all the time without doing something about it. So maybe that's just the way my mom was to me like don't complain about it. And that's sort of how I feel about stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Did she say that often?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and no means she definitely wasn't like a very lovey kind of person. She was more more of a tough love kind of person. So I guess it's probably a little bit where I get it from. I sort of was just forced to get over stuff or deal with it and not have to let you know. There wasn't like very big emotional conversations. It was it was just sort of like suck it up and move on kind of thing. Primea guess that's my mentality where I just sort of end up sucking things up and moving on and not really. You're not saying anything or you know, just letting people walk all over me and not say anything like no or whatever. I just kind of let it happen. People I work for I usually let them I feel like probably walk all over me with you. No watching the kids and always being home and everything, but actually yesterday that I asked me to watch the kids at night and I plan to go to Yogurt to a yoga class and they always ask me like the morning of if they can go out that night and is frustrated me ever since I started and I finally got the got the courage to say to her yesterday. Like I don't mind if you go but I would really appreciate if you give me more than you know, like a 12-hour heads-up because I do have things that I would like to do at night when you get home from work and seeing that I'm the one that that's home all day with the kids.\n",
            "Doctor: my phone\n",
            "Patient: You know Wednesdays are half days of school in Wallingford. So they get out of school at noon. So I have them from noon until 6 or 7 when their parents get home. And I finally just said, you know, like if you're going out if you're going to go out, that's fine, but I need you to tell me before I need you to tell me beforehand. The morning of And that was kind of a big deal for me because I'm usually just when it comes to them or a lot of people understand like okay, okay, okay, whatever and I'll probably complain about it or get annoyed and then don't really say anything to them. So finally saying something. Turn trying to you know convey it was. Convey it in sort of a nice way, you know, if you can just give me a little bit of a heads up and she's understanding about and she was like, I'm sorry, I guess that will try and you know plan a little bit better. Send me that was like a big deal.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel okay?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I was like she because I think sometimes I'm always so afraid that people are going to be mad or she's going to be upset with me. And so I don't want to say anything to really make waves and I would just sort of let them do whatever they wanted and saying something to her really just saying. Oh no, I understand actually fine. It was kind of a relief for me. Because I didn't expect it. I sort of expected her to be annoyed, but she wasn't she totally understood and I think she does understand that. I have a lot on my plate right now. So if they could be a little bit less, I don't know what she we're not really pushy, but if they could be a little bit more, you know, I don't know what the Lord would be in blank now. But considering my time, I guess instead of always just considering there's and you know because they will come home from work whenever they want to and just And they only have an hour or two at the kids. Sometimes they go out and sometimes one has a meeting and they leave anyway, so, you know, it's fine, but I would rather them be able to say things. So I did I feel pretty good, but she wasn't annoyed and I wasn't able to say no. Plus I also feel like at this point. I pretty much just lived to always be there. I'm always at the house always do stuff with kids. And you know, I wasn't there on the weekends a lot when Kevin was living in Maine because it was only a 3-hour drive so I could leave but now that he's living so far away. I can't fly there every weekend. And you know when I was there on the weekends, I was always doing stuff with them and always being with them and I'm like, I can't be here all the time because it's making me nuts, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: What is your agreement with them in terms of how much you work?\n",
            "Patient: Technically, I only work after school Monday through Friday. Like I pick the kids up from school Monday through Friday. And then if one of them one of them has to she always leave you to work at 7:20. But he usually takes the kids to school but he has to go in early or something. Then I'll take the kids to school. Start of the agreement and then I have the weekends myself and I'll go out like once or twice during the week and that's fine. But it's sort of got to the point where you know, if I was there on the weekends they were like, oh, well, we're just going to run to the store. Would you mind watching the kids or we're just going for a walk? Would you mind watching the kids? And since you're home sort of thing. Kind of like they were taking advantage of the fact that I was there and I and that I live there and I don't have anywhere else to go. It's not like I'm leaving and going to my own house. So it sort of was getting really frustrating. And they were taking up all my time and they were taking just clearly taking advantage of me there of me being there and I was getting really frustrated and now I kind of feel like alright. Well if I'm going to have to be here on the weekends, I'm also going to have to start by any other things to do and certified separating myself from always having to do stuff with them and not really feeling obligated that I have to Like I don't have to eat dinner with them and I don't have to. Sit down and have breakfast with them and I don't have to go everywhere and sort of. Do my own thing and hopefully as a happens over the next 6 months, you will make me a little less stressed out and just feeling trapped. Because when you're living and working all the time in the same house. And then on the weekends are not really getting a reprieve from the same people in your just with them seven days a week and I'm with the kids, you know, seven days a week. And you know a normal job, but I would have my weekends free and there was a lot of times that even when I was in Maine, they sort of didn't really respected the fact that I was away and they would you know, they wouldn't call so much but you know, they send me emails and one time there's a snowstorm. I think it was back in November or something, or maybe it was October. There was the hurricane and I was up in Maine and they're like, you know kids don't have school, but they emailed me Eric. In the morning and said, can you be home by noon? And it's a three and a half hour drive for me. So I Finally crawling was like no, I can't be home until noon because this you know 8 in the morning or asking me to be home in like 3 hours or you know know on the way. and it's just like little stuff that that I didn't I don't even think they pay much mind to. Is your sweater? Yeah, whatever. But to me, I'm like your started invading my personal space I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: because that feels familiar\n",
            "Patient: My mom's always done that. She never really gives me a break and I just want to have some time to myself. And they kind of are always just taking advantage of stuff and it gets really frustrating and they don't I think unless I say something and I'm like I did yesterday about not asking the day of about watching the kids. The probably won't ever really change. So I feel like now I have to sort of do things and not be around so much. I don't really think that they care but it's like to them if I'm there then. What's the difference? So there's sort of like a little lack of respect in the whole boundary situation. So that sort of adds to some of my stress being there all the time and not being able to sort of get out. Hopefully I'll be able. To be a little bit more assertive about my own time on the weekends if I'm going to be there. And that should help.\n",
            "Doctor: Because it takes I mean certainly they should be more thoughtful of you. They definitely should but it takes two to be taken advantage of its both people who are either until into or just not thinking about another person and then you are not setting the boundaries.\n",
            "Patient: Right, and I sort of as I was thinking like, you know, I let them because I don't say no and I don't want to upset them by saying no or you know, anything like that. So they're not intentionally trying to take advantage of me, but they are. And so it does, you know, it works both ways, you know, I'm sort of allowed them to do it. And they just going to continue to do it whether there. Go to singer. So even though this is my last sort of six months there. I feel like I'm going to have to really start putting my foot down over the next 6 months or I'm going to go crazy. Being there all the time. It's just a lot never having a break especially with the kids because they don't really have There's No Boundaries and when their parents come home and they started. And they can sort of leave me alone. And I don't mind a thing. It's just I constantly ask all of us for stuff when you know.\n",
            "Doctor: There's no separate.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, there's not really any separation. I sort of become less like the nanny more just part of the family. So, you know when we go places she doesn't even like introduce me as a nanny. She's like I was just feel like still so bad introducing you like that because I feel like you're more of like family. I'm just like, oh, okay. That's fine. That's great. But you know when it comes to things like having boundaries and separation and giving me my own personal space. When I needed it, especially when I'm there all the time. Oh boy.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, we're going to have to stop for today.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Can I just ask you if I I don't if I'll need this and if you can't do it, that's fine, but I'm wondering if we would be able to start 10 minutes earlier on Thursday. Is that a possibility?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's fine.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: at 10 after 1\n",
            "Doctor: It would be 10. I'm not entirely I'm not entirely I'm teaching until the end of the month and my schedule is shifting a little bit.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: So I'm not even sure that would work, but would it be okay?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, we need to do if we need to explain.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, okay.\n",
            "Patient: Yep, absolutely.\n",
            "Doctor: I very much respect times and don't like to move them.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, no, no. No, I usually would be here on time. But today I got a late start. But yeah, that's fine. Okay, great.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so let you know let's do 1:20 unless I contact you. Okay, very good.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: Have a good trip.\n",

            "Doctor: come on it\n",
            "Patient: So I guess the thing that's I did have I had Carl actually look up about the possible hormone issue from last last week because I wanted to say I was afraid that if I was looking I could tell it was sort of thing. That was that was that with what the state of how I was feeling at the time that it was just going to sort of trigger the same reactions over again. I looked it up that looking up was just going to bring you down again. So ask Carl if you check it out and he found that it basically there were a lot of women that were talking about it online and I definitely made me and then I could tell you know after the next day I was feeling a bit better and then the day after that I was feeling basically normal again. So yeah, it was obviously there was something something hormonal going in there and that was the sort of triggering that sort of response. What was interesting that yesterday. I started to get I got one of my more normal sort of. Zelonis and I think because it came so soon after I was able to compare what was going on. And the things I noticed was I was at home in the afternoon when I was starting to feel it already that in the morning. But when I was at home with Genevieve in the afternoon car was out and Genevieve is great, but she's not much of a conversationalist. I was sort of I guess focusing and thinking on it and I realize that I really needed to go for a walk. I needed to take her and go out for a walk and that would make me feel much better. If I could just take Genevieve and go for a walk what you did we walk to work because it was a half hour walk and that was around the time when Carl usually comes home. So we walked there and then walk back and it was and I saw and yes the sort of The exercise and fresh air and pushing myself to go out was not solving any problem, but I did help sort to sort of bring it back in his perspective. I guess in a way which was totally different from when I had that sort of that issue earlier with the and when I got my. And I was going outside and it's what I remember from before when I was in high school or going outside walking with something that it didn't help any I just it was going on and I just had sort of ride it out. If I was outside, then it meant that I was trying to prevent myself from crying in public as opposed to cry at home and it probably wasn't very helpful because you know, then my what I want to do is just start hide at home, so I won't go outside and crime public. So it was that was just sort of an interesting with an interest in contrast for me. I guess in a sense just sort of think about what's something that I can what areas are the sort of things to work on or dwell on in a way and what sort of things that are obviously just well that's a physical thing. That's not really in my control right now and I can't really go in there and manipulate what my cells are doing. I guess it was coming out from I don't even really know exactly what was either triggering or just going on yesterday. It sounds funny but I think part of it was just it was gray. So I felt gray. I don't think I was the only one there only for students who came to get reception yesterday. So normally I have time to 12 but it was then sort of dwelling a lot in my life. Since last week was was thinking about the dead if you're feeling really bad about feeling bad I guess and I was like, I think one of the funny thing about it is that it doesn't really feel like it's the trait isn't here in our natural to me. It feels like it's sort of I guess call and Isis part of me. Funny cuz you know, it's sort of a and obviously it's the response to Pasta. So it's pardon me, I guess and just another way to twist it around. It's something that I don't really like and it's just another way of putting it but I think that one of the one of the interesting aspects but when I was thinking about it before was the connection I made with you know that I'm very conscious that it does come from but it does come from growing up with Leah who is very very focused on the shoulders and I ought to should not tooth and that kind of idea of personality and well it sort of got me thinking a little bit about these are not just of that if personality of Leah is very much. She's very particular which means that she often times ends up with a lot of you know, it's he carried it far but she does end up with a lot of things that produce a lot of really great things. So well, you know it was but I could tell that that's wearing me a lot of this sort of It would definitely have an enormous influence Over Me growing up. She's my big sister. And I mean my parents point out that as of a certain age when we were kids if you look at us and pictures via is always looking at the camera and I'm always looking at Leah I we were just we were very close and I adored and I do adore her. She's my sister and I love her but at the same time that I fully know that that influence had in some respects it led me into great places and I read great things and I tried out things and so on but in other respects it I know that some of that a lot of those aspects of myself which hold back while myself back come from her ideas and ideals and the sorts of rules that she sets a place for herself which carried over into me it sort of I'm not a person who has a lot of very clear memories from when I was a kid. So but when I look back at when I try to sort of cast my mind back to get more oppression and What are my specific memories come from when I was a little bit older usually after when I was in grade 3 we move to Cleveland for a year. My father had a sabbatical year and we moved back to Frank which is where I grew up and it runs like for grade 4 and 5 and then when I was going into 6th grade 6 we move to Cleveland permanently and around then is when more specific memories really start and I'm really sure it's because when I was a little kid, I was basically just sort of zoned out pretty heavily. I didn't have a huge number of friends or anything and I didn't care because I didn't really need them because I had my friend Jen I have the and so I said when I was at a friend's house often would end up sort of quietly with the parents because I wasn't very rambunctious in my personality and I was just I was pretty happy moving to Cleveland. Although ultimately had a lot of good for me. I don't think it was much too short of traumatic for me and either grade 3 or an a grade civics. I was very unhappy and I'm pretty sure my parents didn't really realize how much because I wasn't it's not that I wasn't I wasn't very talkative about things I just I'm more or less left. To lie again you know I should know what things were right to say so she would do the talking and I'm not they knew that grade 3 wasn't my best year but I don't think that they recognized when we moved the Cleveland and grey sex scene when I wasn't happy about it you knew that I really didn't want to leave Jenna particular Jen was my best friend still is I don't think they realized I'm in fact I'm sure that they didn't realize that grade 6 is going to be the best for me it was an incredibly painful urine\n",

            "Patient: First of all, I just really really miss jen-jen there two friends who have meant the most to me Jenn and Lucy Jen I think of her I it's funny. I usually Hobbies ideas. But when, what comes to mind with Jen is yellow golden Sunny yellow when they got married and had this idea at first it was going to be a Sunday afternoon wedding not usually all about the clothes for sure, but I Add s i t a r i a nice yellow dress and then everything changed upside down and then I was going to be an evening wedding and my mom thought I should get a fancy dress. So I got a fancy or dress. I wasn't so thrilled with having a fancy dress, but it was nice, but I got a green one and I like green. But when Jem Genting I just looked at her and I saw just I went to my closet and I gave her the dress cuz I realized I'd gotten her I'd gotten hadn't gotten this dress for me. I got in it for then she wore it in it and just sunshine. It's she's I mean a very a laughing person. She's one who what she she always had pets growing up and I love that because when I went to her house, I got to play with her dogs with her cats going to have passed because my parents only I were all allergic so I got them sort of vicariously through Jen and it really really hurt me to leave leave her because she's just on top of just being so cheerful and making the best of things very accepting a little bit more. I guess more impulsive less less held back by things in my with my personality. It was something that I like to see it was a pretty big wrench to leave her. Also. I just it's funny when I lived in Frankfurt either fewer people and it was quieter and all of that which is more in line with my personality. Begin with but I was not empty your place, but I never felt really lonely there when we moved the Cleveland which was full of people all over the place and you can never be alone. I felt very lonely being surrounded by business annoys people time. And then what was really hard and 6th grade was I started in grade 6 was I started in a school with my parents just said there was a language immersion school system. I started in language immersion. I'm sorry is school system. And so I thought it was the best way to continue our culture. It was also a private school where my mother was teaching but it was going to it was first of all there weren't they weren't sure about putting me into school where my mother was teaching.\n",
            "Doctor: So that's called culture immersion school and anglophone school. I don't think I've ever heard those terms before.\n",
            "Patient: Cultural immersion is the technical terms in Midwest and the school was where in a more cultural neighborhood of the city fathers North start of getting into the more cultural territory and they were hoping that would be that would continue my language education, which is something I was definitely gung-ho about as well. I've always love languages and I certainly ardently love French literature still do half of what I work on our different languages. So is all sort of for a very good plan and practice it turned out to be really really awful the students were it was not a good fit for me at all, but it turned out that my class is run by a student who my memory from the first day of class, but she rounded up all the girls in the class and put us around in a circle and she stood in the middle and based on shoes. She went around said you're basically you're in you're not\n",
            "Doctor: I remember you telling me this story. So this was in which school?\n",
            "Patient: It was called it was in grade 6 in Cleveland.\n",
            "Doctor: So this was the other school that your mother taught at.\n",
            "Patient: This was the other one my mother taught at the French school, which is a private school. This was public part of the public school system. Yeah. I thought he that bad this one before I was sort of\n",
            "Doctor: And you move there for your dad's job or you move there free or you move there for your dad's job.\n",
            "Patient: we moved the Cleveland not for his job. We moved there because in grade 3 we went on a sabbatical then my father is he left his job in Frankfurt? He was a professor at the University there any left for a number of reasons that year they had been planning on it already. They wanted to move back to Cleveland because they wanted to for my perspective in grade 6 it was in but they wanted to move there for Education the new that the quality of Education dropped after Elementary School in Frankfort, and they wanted us to have a better education also Jewish Community which just didn't exist in Frankfurt. So it was really in a funny way of the spur funny to me now if it was for us it definitely didn't feel that way at the time. I really love Frankfort and I miss everything about it. We have had a much easier transition and I think a part of what was sort of wrenching for me was that before then? I haven't really been really intense with Leah, you know, she was much more social than I was she had more friends. She had more she was more of an extrovert. She was just more Out of there. She had the ideas. I went with her plans, but and she missed Frankfort. It's just a she has this kind. She also has this kind of Ideal view of Frankfort. So sometimes email me that she's going home sick and she misses the sort of Simplicity and beauty and niceness of it almost need sometimes when I read those emails. It feels like I'm reading a fairytale. It's not how I remember things. I don't remember like yes, it was beautiful. It was really I loved it. But I remember Winters being extremely hard and we had that 6 foot snow storm sure. It was pretty and it's something sort of talked about looking back. But at the time it was pretty hard a lot of mosquitoes in the summer insanely painful. There are not mosquitoes like that anywhere else, but I don't know it's just something about it feels a bit unreal and it certainly like for her the transition was she had an okay year at school. Then she went to the high school which we both attended jade made a lot of friends there and her husband now is one of somebody who was in her class in high school. It was all final smelly for her I had a real struggle until I Grace 6 if I could erase it I would grade 7 I went to a different school it was just a grade 7/8 school so smaller I'd had teachers if you were a little bit more specialized in dealing with that rather difficult Agency Group and one of my still sort of halfway in touch with some of my teachers from their who is extremely patient and sweet with me and that's where I'm at my friends see who liked genchi you know both of them interesting me they never went to University or a couple of years and then which were Lucy never went to University there more the people who ball to do What they want they do it. They're both very much creatures of the place where they live Jen tried to have tried a number of times to leave Frankfurt or the east coast and she never could she never could live elsewhere. Now. She's living in Iceland that's about as much of a deviation as she can make from there and I cannot imagine losing anywhere other than Cleveland and it's kind of interesting me to me that the two friends. I need to sort of anchor me in a way are those people who sort of moved to their own Rhythm or not? So concerned about conventions or making or was perfectly right all the time. They don't worry about making mistakes because I'll just try again later. just sort of getting trying to think back because a lot of what I you know, a lot of what I itsfunneh a lot of what I know about my growing up with Leo And is what I heard my parents or other people in a way because I said my own memories are kind of sparse from when I was younger. My mom. My dad will comment on Leah being kind of bossy Kind Of Man armor marked many times me that although you've always been very protective of David. Or her telling me that she remembers that I would always be very excited when Jen came over to play but I usually end up sitting somewhere else. I'll be up late with Jen and I have a memory which is I was always very excited to go over to Jen's house play partly I think because of the animals the cats and it's also partly because I did I don't remember from when I was littler but when I was older, I definitely remember certainly back they had to sense of Jen because we were the same being very much my friend and then Leah wanted to play with us all the time and I sometimes felt a little bit left out, I guess in a Party of Three instead of a party of two. I think I had a sense that I wasn't very good at having friends when he came back from Cleveland. I think that's when I start began to sort of feel that difference between we are being quite good socially and me being sore. Focus on the outside not really knowing how to play. I feel like I wasn't very good at being a kid. I had a and of course like now I look and I think they're all kinds of kids. I just had a feeling that I wasn't very good at it that I probably seem to get along better with many adults. Of course now when I think about it, I probably just didn't really find a good group of kids. I wasn't or didn't have a kind of chameleon personality, which I can fit in with very many people. I still don't But I remember when I I guess this was around and grade for grade 5 when we came back from Cleveland before we moved permanently when I was on the in the playgrounds girls at lunch or recess or something, and I wanted to play at the only things I ever really wanted to play. Or some type of fairies or miss or something like that. I read fairy tales I dread mythology. I was obsessed. and and who grew up on a farm nearby and sure she was very nice. But we tended to butt heads as much as I could. I wasn't really very good at that sort of thing. But she was she wanted to play horses because she grew up on a farm. She loves horses the way that I love cats in mythology and she loves horses. She loves the things that you saw every day. And I said, okay. Yeah, that's fine. We'll play horses. I don't know nothing about horses. So I wanted to be Pegasus because that was the horse. I knew she was Furious she was so angry because I still don't really know very much about horse says it could be a black horse or White Horse. I don't really know anything about horses a mare a stallion. I guess the horses don't have wings. There wasn't a horse on her Farm Gladwin, so can't do that. And that's what I was, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: mythical horse with wings\n",
            "Patient: It's just that sort of that's where I was like with other kids. And so I just and the great thing about being backed about back in Cleveland was when I her it was sort of like she read Every she just there's a reason I think. It was in all of them the course textbooks and she just read everything in my way. I felt at that point was that it gave me enough for somebody to hang out with just let me Mark time until so I guess I reach the more it's I wanted to go to university. I wanted to go to university not because just because I wanted the courses and the more, you know being able to write about what I wanted to write and she's my classes and I wanted to go to university because you didn't have lunch hour you didn't have recess you don't have a cafeteria where all the kids going to have to find a table to sit with other people. I found extremely stressful. you had I tried to live in a dorm for 2 years, but then since I was in Cleveland, I just I live at home for the next two years because I didn't the messing it's just got to be too much and after that was just Greater degrees that sort of Independence I guess but of course the thing is at all of these those stages in between are supposed to teach you about getting along and making compromises and so on and I guess what's really the something that wasn't I guess it's not an issue of getting along and making compromises. I do both of those things extremely. Well, I'm not the most social person in the world, but I definitely don't mind, you know people who are different from your with no major issues that I didn't manage to workout in the stages of how to say in that that okay. You don't have to like my shoes. Why would I care whether you like my shoes are not they're comfortable. They work they provide that layer between my feet in the ground. They're supposed to do if you don't like them fine. You don't have to it's not your business. That's a problem that I didn't manage to work on those stages, I think.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you're doing it now Under Fire.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And in the immersion the immersion experience of having to do that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: A less equipped than you'd like but defining the issue which is half the battle in understanding the issue making it clear to yourself.\n",
            "Patient: I guess that's\n",
            "Doctor: Sorry. Okay going to need to actually stop it in a moment.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. So yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You we're about to say something though.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, it's in. Hi Carl, can I call you back? Yeah, it's just that it's it's true. It's like a sort of a I guess the thing is that to me. It's a I think that what I like what I just reached right now where my instinct was. Yes compromise. That's what you need to to. That's what you didn't learn. That's what you know, you put children. They get more social and they compromised and learnt work together. I had to turn down a little bit now. I can't go anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: I will see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: So I'm clear you have no insurance, but you don't have any information yet. When you get it, you'll give it to me and I will give it a whirl billing it and we'll see how that goes.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I need to catch my breath post office downstairs is awfully cranky.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, really?\n",
            "Patient: I got here early.\n",
            "Doctor: This is the Kinko's.\n",
            "Patient: No, the US Post Office. I got here a little bit early because I had a package to mail to a friend in the UK one was ridiculously long and the forms were Olmec stop and not labeled labeled with the name of the form. I finally found the Forum that said customs declaration. I spent time filling it out while people behind me skipped me and lying to go ahead while I was writing. I finally get to the table and the guy is like is this the wrong form? I was like, okay, what form do I need to go back and get the Customs form? It says Customs form. Well, that's the Customs form for packages over 16 oz well, it doesn't say that on the form and I didn't know and then he made me go get back in the back of the line. Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: A lot of times they just let people if they make you go get something they just say come back up to the front not today.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What's on your mind?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm tired and cranky and not feeling well.\n",
            "Doctor: like emotionally\n",
            "Patient: and physically\n",
            "Doctor: all around\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I've had a headache all day, but it's been resistant to painkillers both over-the-counter and prescription. Dave and I have been fighting a lot the last couple of days. I've been feeling really low and mood has been lower the past week and a half to two weeks than it has been in quite a while. I told him I was feeling low and that I was just really upset about a lot of things and I've been having his meltdowns at the end of the day. We're almost like a little kid having a meltdown. It's just that they're too tired and they need to go to sleep. But they refused to it's the same sort of completely losing all grip on reality and feeling like everything is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I know those are really stressful for Dave to witness. I really try to keep them bottled up and not expose him to it, but I don't know. I've been tired of having this shaky Edge on my self-control the last week or so. Anyway, I told him I was feeling really bad and I was really upset about the whole insomnia situation and that it's not getting any better. I have so much trouble getting to sleep staying asleep.\n",
            "Doctor: I know you mentioned it, but we hardly talked about it. Can you tell me a little bit more about what happens?\n",
            "Patient: It's just I can't sleep ever. I'll be completely exhausted at work at my desk falling asleep or sitting at home in my home study or on the couch not enough as soon as I get to bed. I'm wide awake and I can't get to sleep. It's really frustrating.\n",
            "Doctor: And how long do you usually live there?\n",
            "Patient: Until 2 or 3 in the morning.\n",
            "Doctor: When are you first in bed?\n",
            "Patient: Usually between 11 and midnight.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, and then do you usually get up at 2 or 3 or do you eventually, no or\n",
            "Patient: I eventually conk out.\n",
            "Doctor: And then do you sleep through until someone in the morning sometime in the morning?\n",
            "Patient: No, I usually wake up two or three times a night.\n",
            "Doctor: and then you get up at\n",
            "Patient: Depending on how much ice. Depending on how much sleep I've gotten and how much willpower I have between 7 and 8.\n",
            "Doctor: you're sleeping about 5 hours or so with two or three interruptions in an ongoing way.\n",
            "Patient: Yep.\n",
            "Doctor: I assume you've got some good drugs for this but clearly not good enough.\n",
            "Patient: Ambien doesn't work. I was trying to Ambien, but it just doesn't knock me out. I tried trazodone which is an antidepressant not and hypnotic what it does.\n",
            "Doctor: It's you talking for sleep.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, and the problem with that is even at the smallest doses 1/4 of the smallest tab that is manufactured. It will knock me out, but then I'll sleep for 10 hours and feel hungover when I wake up. I have the same problem with Benadryl.\n",
            "Doctor: Be reset often times when people have an ongoing sleep difficulty like that if they get one night or a couple nights of decent sleep and then makes it easier after that. Is that happened with you?\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so if you took Benadryl for a couple of nights, took it early plan to go in late to that over the weekend. There would be no difference on the next night. Okay, and how long has it been like this?\n",
            "Patient: years\n",
            "Doctor: You've been getting 5 hours a night with two to three interruptions for years.\n",
            "Patient: Yep on weekends, like generally Saturday mornings. I'll just not turn on the alarm and I'll sleep and get 10 or 12 hours. Wake up at 10:30 or 11.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so if you could go to sleep every night at 2 or 3 and wake up at 10 or 11, which I know you can't realize but to understand that would be better.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know how I could get my sleep cycle to move earlier. It should be a simple thing because I'm waking up between 7 and 8 you would think I would just fall asleep after 16 hours of being awake, but no.\n",
            "Doctor: Who prescribes for you?\n",
            "Patient: I don't have a name. I saw a doctor Morgan, but I didn't like him at all. I missed an appointment because I screwed up my calendar and I was too embarrassed to call and tell him that I recorded it wrong. Then time went by and I got increasingly too embarrassed to call and asked to reschedule. Yeah, that was in October.\n",
            "Doctor: What had he prescribed?\n",
            "Patient: He prescribed nothing. He said that they sell the notes that he got for my previous psychiatrist myself reported symptoms. He didn't think I needed antidepressants anymore. You wrote me a script for Ativan used as an to use on an as-needed basis and I haven't run out that script yet because I haven't actually felt the need for it. He said he wanted to check in again in six weeks. So we did and he said sounds good. Nothing has changed. Let's check in again in six weeks and that's the appointment I missed.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, right. This is a psychiatrist, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is pretty aggressive about the sleep stuff. Did she try other things besides Ambien and trazodone?\n",
            "Patient: She was the one who told me to do, Benadryl.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, which has the same stuff is?\n",
            "Patient: She got really aggressive about monitoring my sleep hygiene and telling me I had terrible sleep hygiene and to do better and he's sleep problems would just go away if I followed the rules better.\n",
            "Doctor: She did nothing.\n",
            "Patient: Nope.\n",
            "Doctor: Have you ever tried?\n",
            "Patient: I had not.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess I'm thinking it might be good to get you a new prescriber.\n",
            "Patient: I haven't tried Lunesta either that's an option.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, okay. Look I don't mean to derail us and actually talking about what's going on. Nor am I convinced that this will solve your sleep problems or that my guy giving you antidepressants right now is even possible but I think some of the stuff might help we should probably get the ball rolling on that think of a lot of things one if you email me do you want to use your insurance for it?\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, if you email me the list of people in your insurance were in the area. I can look through it and see if there's someone I know unless you think you might know somebody already it will probably meet a bunch of calls.\n",
            "Patient: Yep.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Alright we can stop with that for now. It just seems like that's a good ball to get moving. You probably tried about a million things for sleep. So I'm not going to try and suggest anything for sleep because you probably already tried it a few times and doesn't work.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. But yeah, I was telling Dave I was really frustrated that I couldn't get to sleep because this is so stupid. He woke me up less than an hour after I finally dropped off to ask me to move over cuz I was taking up too much space in the bed and then I did not get back to sleep at all that night you woke me up at 5 and then I was just up I couldn't get back to bed when he finally rolled out of bed at 8:30. I was like that was totally unfair don't ever do that again. I know it's not fair to you if I take up more space on the bed and maybe you have to go sleep on the couch and that's not fair, but I need to be able to sleep and I so much trouble sleeping. You just went off at me and yelled at me about how I wasn't doing anything about my sleep problems. And he had told me to try vitamin D because that would fix my sleep problem. And why wasn't I better?\n",
            "Doctor: You tried a whole lot of things if you actually hadn't tried anything, I would take his point but their doctors that are prescribed you three different medications and made a huge but you've tried all of them and it hasn't helped at all.\n",
            "Patient: Is vitamin D suggestion is something that he pulled off the fucking internet. It's not something that came from a doctor and the number of bullshit snake oil fix your life remedies the Davis tried because some of the Quantified Self people did it on themselves. Are you familiar with this phenomenon of the Quantified Self? There's a trend among a certain type of tacky people the medical industrial complex is bullshit and doesn't know anything and you can't trust doctors or medical professionals. The only thing you can trust is yourself because no one knows your body as well as you do so they do experiments on themselves, untested uncontrolled unscientific experiments and then write blog posts about it. We try each other's ideas for how to lose weight and build muscle and develop chest hair and sleep well and lower your cholesterol by taking 6000 IU of vitamin E. Twist, and I agree with some of the underlined arguments that the medical industrial complex is way too industrialized and big Pharma kind of sucks. doctors were over scheduled and will only see you for 10 minutes really don't know as much about your body as you do because\n",
            "Doctor: It does not necessarily mean the answers on some block on the internet.\n",
            "Patient: Right, so they started yelling that I didn't want to try this vitamin D thing and I was like, well, you're suggesting that I take something like 12 times FDA recommended allowance of vitamin D. A lot of these things. I just read a study about a month ago about how Vitamin C in the doses that people take to fight off winter colds. Like 10,000 IU is actually toxic to your liver. So I really don't want to take 12 times FDA recommended vitamin without medical supervision. He got really mad at me about that. Then a few days later. I told him that I was feeling bad enough that I was worried for my safety. I was afraid I would hurt myself. You just started yelling at me again. He told me I was selfish and I wasn't thinking about his feelings and he wish that he could believe that I loved him, but he can't because if I did I wouldn't be thinking about suicide and it would destroy his world. What if I attempted suicide and failed then I would be mentally disabled like his brother and you really want to be like my brother. Do you really want to have that level of mental reasoning?\n",
            "Doctor: You're feeling extremely sympathetic with him. I'm sure at that point.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, things have been rough with me and Dave and I don't know what to do about it because I know living with me isn't easy. I'm a pain in the ass to live with in some regards. He kind of has a point.\n",
            "Doctor: About what?\n",
            "Patient: About it selfish with me to kind of dumped all my internal Chaos on him and not provide better buffering and to rely on him as much as I do not sustainable and not fair to him.\n",
            "Doctor: I see I don't question it. But I take your point. It's your view that you're kind of doing it too much to him. I don't know how to evaluate that in a sense because on the one hand. I know you're having a very hard time and there's been stuff at work. You're sleeping 5 hours a night. Maybe we haven't talked much about that because I don't remember some of that or maybe it was a while ago and I forgot. Who knows anyway, whatever. The point is clearly you're having a very shity time. It certainly makes sense to me that you can lead one to dump more on their spouse. Another hand you could you get so angry at yourself for dumping anything on anybody. I could kind of see it going on. Whatever I take your point that it's putting a strain on the relationship.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe this is the sort of thing that we should just see a couples counselor together about.\n",
            "Doctor: You could you could do that.\n",
            "Patient: It drives me crazy. He won't tell me what he's feeling. I'll ask him. Can we talk about how you're feeling? I don't want to right now. Okay, can we set a time to talk? I don't want to spend well, when can we talk? You ask me on the spur of the moment? I haven't had time to put my thoughts together. I can ask you now and I'm going to come back in an hour. Can you put your thoughts together by then and then he won't he claims that he doesn't need to see a therapist to he's had a relationship with his doctor since 2005. He sees him once every three months and it's mostly just to prescribe meds.\n",
            "Doctor: What is a take?\n",
            "Patient: He has ADHD. So he takes Concerta which is one of those drugs for you kind of have to go see a physician in person every 3 months because of FDA regulations. He also does psychoanalysis therapy sort of stuff? He's not just a prescriber, but Dave refuses to go in for therapy to talk about some of the stuff. He won't tell me how he's feeling until he blows up at me and accuses me of not loving him. It's really frustrating.\n",
            "Doctor: Yep, you're utterly overwhelmed.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And at your wit's end.\n",
            "Patient: Yep.\n",
            "Doctor: And how suicidal?\n",
            "Patient: Not close enough to actually be contemplating making plans.\n",
            "Doctor: NAPA Parts good\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But close enough to be thinking about it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I'm really tired of this particular song and dance.\n",
            "Doctor: What's that?\n",
            "Patient: fighting off suicidal urges\n",
            "Doctor: Tell me about how you're really sick of it.\n",
            "Patient: The first time I wanted to kill myself, I was 11. I ate a pack of my parents cigarettes. It was not a very pleasant plan.\n",
            "Doctor: What did they do?\n",
            "Patient: They made me throw up.\n",
            "Doctor: That's it. No shrink.\n",
            "Patient: Nope.\n",
            "Doctor: 11 year old to shrink when they eat a bunch of cigarettes crazy. I mean crazy if your parents you are a super depressed 11 year old pretty unusual for that age to do something like that. I mean 15, okay 11 not so much. I've seen certainly girls who want to jump out a window or something the kids just don't usually try stuff.\n",
            "Patient: I was really isolated throughout my entire childhood. I had no friends at all. I was tormented at school tormented at home, but Even at my happiest in the last 10 years or so. There's always been a thought in the back of my head at things are good now but don't expect them to stay good. You can always kill yourself tomorrow if they stopping good. What's that saying from The Princess Bride? I'll kill you tomorrow.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, or Sahara said the Arabian Nights. Is that right?\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I'll kill you in the morning. Yeah. I mean, sometimes it's been the kind of Downer. This is your jerk Cloud on a sunny day. And sometimes it's been literally the only thing that's kept me from doing something right now.\n",
            "Doctor: You'll still have the option.\n",
            "Patient: Right. I can always change my mind about living tomorrow. I'm kind of sick of having that thought always in my head.\n",
            "Doctor: What's amazing is you're having a really really hard time?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I feel like it's always a really really hard time. There's no founding to that. It's an endless hard time.\n",
            "Doctor: You might be right about that, but I'm not sure on one hand. Clearly. There's some of the stuff that we don't talk about that much and maybe we should more and I don't know. How much is that? I just haven't blown haven't known about the ongoing way in which some of these things are just completely awful is not come across so loud and clear to me as day last spring when you were in school. There was a time when it was really bad there have been some times when you started working where I don't think of it as bad, but I guess they didn't seem to me that they had been this bad again. I don't know if it's if that's just sort of my not knowing about it or if you're feeling like things are going that way now and Something's Happened the question is which is it.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. There was the time I think it was last spring when you were pretty close to taking some pills, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it was actually last winter. It was why I fired my previous therapist.\n",
            "Doctor: There was another time since we had been meeting where you would open the cabinet. Was it before we went?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I probably told you all about it.\n",
            "Doctor: right I'm confused because I thought you had fired her because of how she was about some of the stuff you were talking about.\n",
            "Patient: There was a lot that I didn't like about the treatment plan that she had of the straw that broke. The camel's back was that I had been wanting to kill myself the point where I was hoarding pills and I got scared and have to ask Dave to come home. I take them and hide them she completely blew that off and redirected the conversation talking about my dad and why he is the way he is kind of armchair diagnosing him from a distance, which I certainly don't have enough insight into what's going on to provide enough symptoms for\n",
            "Doctor: That's certainly not useful or a string style to diagnose anybody that you haven't met with.\n",
            "Patient: Right. Maybe he does have PTSD that's quite likely given his history, but there is nothing I can do about that.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, it certainly wasn't relevant at that moment. Okay, let me be very clear when I'm going to say I'm not blaming you. I'm waving my arms saying that I'm not blaming you but I can but I think it can be hard sometimes but I'm glad you're doing it now for you to say how awful our dire things are. And what all is contributing to that. I think there are. Hard for you, and that's why I'm asking. I'm not blaming you. Also. I'm glad you're letting me know. Now. You already told me last week things were worse. You don't hide things exactly.\n",
            "Patient: I have a strongly develops instinct to mask.\n",
            "Doctor: I think so. I think you're worried about talking about it with some people when they don't it feels more aggressive. Like they're kind of angrily keeping things back. I think you're more frightened. I could be wrong, but you probably feel pretty ashamed about it and worried that it's going to make you look like assholes and if whoever isn't really going to want much more to do with you, is that about right?\n",
            "Patient: Yep. I'm also worried that if I let other people know just how bad things are. It will use that to take advantage of me.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. I know there's a lot that we haven't touched on about how things are awful a lot to do with how sleeping affects you work, which is what we were talking about last time. I think and some of the suicidal thinking I know I've asked a lot of questions. I guess I sort of felt like I want to get the lay of the land a little bit and worry about missing other things. Are there other things at the moment that we are missing. Are there other things that are feeling as bad as well.\n",
            "Patient: There's The Chronic NeverEnding stresses my parents which waxes and wanes is that again waxing and waning but never fully going away. I have anxiety around friendships and do people actually want me around and what is my value and all of that?\n",
            "Doctor: When is the trip with your family?\n",
            "Patient: May 15th through 27th\n",
            "Doctor: I thought it was March or may it's me. What's on your mind at the moment?\n",
            "Patient: We have to get these nuts for this trip to China and my dad won't make up his mind whether he wants to deal with getting visas for everyone or whether he wants me and Dave to get her own. I emailed him to stay the trip is in 4 months. We need to get our visas. Do you want me to mail your passport and visa application so you can get everyone to be says he replied with a big incoherent rambling. I replied back and said just tell me either way, but we need to know I cc'd my sister because my sister has been pretty much the only person in my family and I include myself in this criticism was capable of dealing with Logistics and keeping track of things and staying organized. She sent me this really nasty email back saying, I don't know why this is such a big deal for you whether you send them to the travel agent or whether dad sends them. Why do you care stop bugging. Stop using email? You should call and talk to him. I was like a I hate using the phone having. Are you on the phone in the best of cases? I have a hard time understanding my dad because he mumbles see an email at least has a record of what is said that has a hard time understanding me because I don't know. He says my English isn't clear enough for him that I talk too fast and use too many big words, even though I make every effort when I'm talking to him to speak slowly and clearly\n",
            "Doctor: I don't find you a particular or particularly difficult to understand.\n",
            "Patient: My dad makes a big deal of his not being a native English speaker, even though he learned English when he was 8 years old and has been speaking it since then and speaks fluently. I think he just uses it as an excuse, but with the written word, you can read it if you don't understand and there's no wall. Also it matters because I don't want to just send a passport to travel agent. I need a booking code or something so that the travel agent knows who these passports are for. I ended up reading the whole log of items and emails between my family and myself about the stupid fucking trip and I didn't realize until I read them all together and every single regard about the Lightning Thief and disrespectful and dishonest with me. It's not about looking dates that I didn't want to go. It was also. Dad emailed me and said the travel agency offers flights to China from La Boston or Chicago. The default is LA and you have to pay more to go from Chicago or Boston. What did David I want he gave us a table prices. I said why don't you book a straight from Boston because the surcharge from the travel agency is less than the cost of a plane ticket from Boston to LA and summary. Please book us from Boston. Your license says we will see from La you can call the travel agent. If you want to go from Boston I said, but you asked me and I said book from Boston. He was like, we don't know your schedule. Your booking a strep. The schedule is determined by the flight from LA. I was like, okay fine. We'll book the fucking flight from Boston to La give me the contact info for the travel agent. He didn't send it. There were three emails in a row from me to Dad saying give me the info for the travel agent so I can book us from Boston to LA. Finally, he said it's such and such travel agency. Don't something I don't remember now. He gave me the name of the travel agency. I was like, okay fine and he said no no, we'll do the add-on since you don't want to pay for it. I was like, it's not the money. It's not being able to have that name and the information to call. He was like, you don't have to go to the travel agency. Why don't you just booked a ticket on the internet from Boston to LA? I was like, okay, what time does our flight from LA to part? I don't know. Why do you want to know that?\n",
            "Doctor: We should stop.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry, I got going.\n",
            "Doctor: No, no, it's okay. Go ahead.\n",
            "Patient: I hate my parents. That's all.\n",
            "Doctor: This is another can of worms, but I have three things quickly. When is do you want to talk more about the trip? I know you haven't been hot about whether to go or not. Maybe it's worth thinking about a little more. I don't want to put something out that stress on you if it's going to feel stressful to think about we will wait a while second. I wonder if it would be helpful to have another time here. I would have to check. I'm pretty whacked at the moment, but I would do what I could to do that if that might help I don't want to start a promise or dangle. I just don't know if I have that I will look.\n",
            "Patient: It would have to be a morning because of scheduling with work and leaving early.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, that's in third. I hope I mumbled something about this when you first brought it up, but certainly if you have been suicidal and scared you can call me I get calls. I don't want to say all the time, but certainly sometimes like that have i mumbled something about that before. Okay, good enough. All right.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: How have you been?\n",
            "Patient: So I don't know what's going on this week thing that I've been really noticing and something I've had all along that I think we haven't really dressed in here. I think is important because it really bothers me but I feel super it hasn't been non-stop all week. But I've been feeling like super aggravated Melancholy sarjak. That's not a good combination. I don't know like today. I'm super fucking annoyed every little thing. I just don't I don't know. I just don't like that. That's the kind of thing that my friend Dave does who I think of like will joke once in a while. I'm out like that to like it just really bothers me. That I get like that.\n",
            "Doctor: What kind of things today are coming up as an example?\n",
            "Patient: Today was the first thing was I go out out there trash garbage was yesterday or this morning? and it's like I just get annoyed. Downtown has these new craftsman things, which is great, but I went out there one of my and one of the neighbors Ben's it somehow gone on our side and I don't know why it just took me off. I annoy the fucking shit out of me.\n",
            "Doctor: Meaning they've been emptied but somehow God.\n",
            "Patient: Are you sure we're in the garbage guys know they're doing all this shit. They just kind of dumped a little a little more on our side. You know, it's just annoyed me like all these fucking garbage cans in front of our house. So I was moving it and then my mom showed up with her with my grandmother and adenoids me. Like of course, I can't just be in peace like this fucking moment. You have to show up. I don't I don't know that just annoyed me. I don't know. I just felt really annoyed really annoyed then to just get a cup of coffee. It sounds like An old man, but it has gotten so fucking crowded. It's like that. It's like it has become this major thoroughfare. It's like no parking people are double-parked people are honking and of course everyone to ass also. Assholes they know how to park. They don't know how to use their signals, you know. I was like what the so that just annoyed me. I don't know just everything.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. I just feel.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I just feel aggravated. It's bothering me.\n",
            "Doctor: They're both examples of people you're sensing that you're territories being encroached upon.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I know. That's what I was thinking of like and must be some you know, it's again, it's that feeling that somehow people are doing something on purpose to me. You know what I mean somehow. I don't but it's not the case, but I don't know when I was little I used to have a bad temper. I think I've said that so I'm sure it's somehow connected. I used to have just like Dido from being the way I normally am like, I'm very patient and then you do not want to be around me if No. If I you know washed it and then end like it even happened here. I was like what the fuck somebody at 12:50. What the fuck? It's 12:53. What the fuck? Why are you are getting so you know I get these little things it's really it's like my friend Dave were very it's like personal. it's as if he's totally it says if it's totally personal and it's like I don't like that feeling, you know. That's like and then I don't like the flipside which is that I've been feeling just really lethargic like kind of melancholy or something like that. I'm just kind of sluggish and tired and just blah. I don't know. What's what that's all about. Like I'm seeing Kelly tomorrow. I should be really excited. You know, I'm sure I will be when I see her but almost feeling worried like I have Like I feel like I'm kind of out of it at or tired. I feel a little bit like what if Like I don't know if it's all these negatives it's weird. I'm like, oh what if I don't know what if I don't perform. Well, sexually or what if I snore when were were asleep. Like weird little you know what? I mean? Like, I don't know man. It's really weird. But I just figured because I don't know. if We've ever talked about that in here on my way here. I was like, you know why I just don't get it. It's not obviously it's part of me. It's not really me. You know what? I mean? I don't know. I don't like getting so worked up about these things.\n",
            "Doctor: You want to know if it's been harder to talk about in a way because it's like maybe this part that doesn't feel calm cool and collected. It feels confusing. What is this inside you when you recognize it's about in the moment and it feels like a small thing, but I don't know but I don't know that in the meaning of it is a small thing inside. It feels a little out of control.\n",
            "Patient: No, that's the thing. I think that's what I decided today, but isn't a small thing just like I don't think it because of what I thought I thought my friend day. I was like when he gets like this, I don't think it's a small thing. Right. I always think man this poor guy. Like there's something deep in him that you know, well, it's the same thing. It's like everyone has that gets aggravated a little here and there but these moments of just intense like I'm giving myself a headache. It's like my head hurts. It's like there's no reason for that is a nice day out. I'm here. Like what's the problem, you know?\n",
            "Doctor: That's what we have to figure out when you're sitting up when you're sitting up there. I wonder if it's if that certain bond that set of feelings too. Then you're sitting there saying, you know, it's another place that feels like someone is encroaching on your space. And you say I can't help I just take it personally. Well, how would you think that when you said say that?\n",
            "Patient: you mean personally, how\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, like what does it mean? What's the unconscious fantasy about it?\n",
            "Patient: I think it's like I don't know. It's like I think it's like part of it. It's like what the fuc doesn't Trisha know what time it is or something or getting annoyed at whoever the person your Patron is that their Ramblin there somehow encroaching on your time, like maybe it's time to go and they're still so I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't really.\n",
            "Patient: I don't really know what it is. It's just yeah, it's just kind of like it's too close for comfort. I feel like you know or then I'll feel Like how the fuck should I be ready to talk to me or anybody when she just talk to this person? You know, I don't know. It's just like a combination of all these but yeah them all. the bottom of the line if feels too close for comfort somehow if you like things are There isn't like breathing a buffer a room.\n",
            "Doctor: And what would happen if that would make you feel better?\n",
            "Patient: Again, I think it's just the idea. Is there when he immediately someone else kind of encroaching, you know what I mean? I think that's what it is. I don't care that there are people. At Dunkin Donuts, it's just when it's so fucking it's almost claustrophobic the double parking lot parking properly. Then you walk in there and there's a fucking half-ass line and just like, I don't know there's something about it. I don't care if there's people if there's some people there but then there's some order, you know, my guess I'll be around and you know, I think that's what it is part of what it is. I mean, for example, I never go to Star Market or CVS or the mall or Target. I never ever go to those places during any time when I think there's a lot of people I just don't like I'd rather go there 10 at night and just feel calm and there's plenty room and you know. Now some of that I think a lot of people do that. Me and I are friends who are like that too. They don't want to go to Target when a sealant when they're Sicilian people, but I think that there's definitely more you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, because I wonder as we think about generalizing it to the garbage cans knew where it's not a until your family arrived. They're still even something happening about that. That is not about feeling claustrophobic with people.\n",
            "Patient: Well, but it is so it's claustrophobic in terms of like this fantasy that somehow their encroaching on MySpace. That's like what?\n",
            "Doctor: Other people's stuff other people's garbage.\n",
            "Patient: Exactly. Like you have all this room. Why is your shit here? I don't get that, you know until I actually I do get it in a way because it's like probably there were 20 cars. They're parked their fucking garbage guys came. They took the cans. That's where they saw there were some there was some space to leave that and they fucking left. I mean, they're not, you know, I know that no one is doing anything on purpose, but it's more how I'm reacting to it.\n",
            "Doctor: Does it make you feel like just a number when there's so many people like how much do you matter or something?\n",
            "Patient: No, no, it's more just again, it's this feeling that of that somehow people are disrespectful or impolite and yeah, there's something overwhelming and cautious throwback about it. I don't know how I how I can explain it. It's kind of like when I'm walking into center of the square, you know, that there's this all these fucking freaks and people yelling at each other and drug addicts and Weirdos like that. I hate it or something. I can't stand about that. You know, I'm not alone. I know it's not send anything. I know I have a couple of friends who cannot stand walking around Central walking around in Central Square. But again, it's a combination of it would be one thing if that kind of stuff just bothered me, but this feeling is getting out of getting so aggravated is just what I don't like. In the weird thing was I woke up and I got a lot done like it has some errands I know. I'm took, you know, like I've been kind of on top of things, you know, so I don't even know why I like.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know why you wanted to just start talking about it. It's a nice dream you like the dreams you used to have you never say much about the dream beyond that it would be yelling screaming usually at your mother and now it's just an image of screaming in one form or another that there's anger there in all of this and how you felt heart felt hard to be in some ways intrusive and claustrophobic Lee humbling and present around you both neglectful and then intrusive at the same time.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, it's funny. I was thinking about that too on my way here. I was like a wonder if it's just the way I That I feel like all of downtown is I mean, this is where I'm from. So maybe that's the thing. I like well I do love it here, but I also want to be left alone, you know, so I wonder if you know what I mean. Like it's like I've always known that I mean in a unique situation. I know a lot of people leave their hometowns and they moved but When you like where you're from? What am I supposed to do? You know what? I mean? Like I guess if I was like really uncomfortable and well-off I would just live somewhere else in this area and you know what I mean, but you know, so I don't know. I wonder if If that's what it is, I feel like I don't know. I don't know if that's totally true. I have a feeling that. It's a lot of the other stuff that's been going on, which is that a lot of this bag revation or whatever. It's not in the present. You know what I mean? It's like some old thing is coming up in situations slitter. Not really that aggravating.\n",
            "Doctor: What's coming to mind when you say that?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I mean, I'm just saying that I think it's probably old.\n",
            "Doctor: Because it looks like there's a lot of feeling going into that.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know just I think I'm just thinking about being a kid in like when I lose my temper my temper, obviously there was something going on. Obviously my family annoyed or whatever the fuck I don't know but\n",
            "Doctor: How would they annoy you?\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I don't know I guess just like I don't know not getting along with my mom or feeling alone or bored.\n",
            "Doctor: How about angry?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah angry annoyed.\n",
            "Doctor: or claustrophobic\n",
            "Patient: Now when I was a kid, I don't think I felt claustrophobia. I know it's I know that I feel\n",
            "Doctor: surrounded by people but still\n",
            "Patient: So even that noise annoys a chamois. I hate that. I hate that I'm like that. That's awful. That's so awful.\n",
            "Doctor: You're so quick to criticize it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, because it's mean it's I mean, it's a little too much like every little thing sets me off like it really makes me super angry and That's like what they're just looking just someone sitting here. They're not it's just you know, you know what it what it is. It's just feel so childish like it's so fucking amateur.\n",
            "Doctor: But why did No Ceilings not mother?\n",
            "Patient: No, no. No, they do matter and just saying.\n",
            "Doctor: What about that sound right now?\n",
            "Patient: Well, what sort is happens on days like this? I feel like I was going to be one of those days where I'm it's almost like I'm asking for it in other words. Because I feel this way that shit's going to happen all day. There's going to be some little tick. It's like I'm being poked and prodded like I was at bothering you today people driving shity and too many people will hate so all day. There's going to be shit is going to be weird noises of people like in your space. They're going to be you know,\n",
            "Doctor: When was Adele and in your face through the day?\n",
            "Patient: yeah, right exactly.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is different than what I think you also know you're touring with understanding that you're because you're feeling this way today, you're picking up on things in different ways. You don't always feel this way. I mean even here.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, we're like in the past like I'm very sensitive to noise. It does bother me, but I've got really good at just being like okay, we all make a little we all live in a society. So no one is doing it on purpose like I've gotten better way better at that. But yeah. But then when it's days like this. like every little thing becomes\n",
            "Doctor: Sin becomes what?\n",
            "Patient: just what I was saying like it becomes my state for the day.\n",
            "Doctor: I get that part but what exactly is it? Is it like an intrusion?\n",
            "Patient: That is not going to be a peaceful day. Like I can't just have a mellow peaceful. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what it is. For example out. I'm going to go to Starbucks and this is going to be the one day where it's like a madhouse. I can't get a place to stay and I gotta gotta leave. I can't I'm just or I'm just going to stand here for a while waiting for some douchebag to leave in like it's going to be an easy day. It's not going to be an I don't know. Then I think what happens is. is that when trickles or turns into self-defeating thoughts, you know what I mean, like well I'm not going to fucking go to the gym. I'm not like, you know, it just becomes very self because what happens on days like this when it's this bad cuz I'm paralyzed for the day. Like I just want to get through the day. I can't do anything. I can't think straight. Can't really enjoy anything. It's very difficult.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know why I keep getting crazy images of something that sounds like a fantasy metaphor because we don't know concretely but something so so clear like as you described let's say walking into Starbucks and this is going to be the day where it's just a zoo and nothing goes my way like the feeling of just wanting to be held and in the environment too kind to kind of hold you and take care of you and have it just be okay and safe and quiet if you want quiet or loud if you want loud or social if you want social or or you know, just the wish for that kind of fallen and hold you that that it keeps getting some days. There's some feelings that that that make that feel like it's getting absolutely squashed.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I don't know like what bothers me ultimately 2 about. That is like I end up feeling like this total utility. Like I just like, you know, it's tied into that whole self-defeating.\n",
            "Doctor: See, I think must have felt that as a baby learned pretty quickly that it wasn't worth it.\n",
            "Patient: As a baby though. I mean why I can't even understand that because I mean the weird thing is that I think it is a baby. That's when I was most loved I was there was no other baby in the family. I was the first one and I've seen the all the pictures photos and stuff like that, you know and the center of attention so I can't see how That would be the case when I got a little bit older. Or maybe maybe there's something I'm not I'm not aware of.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know exactly what I do know is but I do know his parents don't have a personality transformation between when their child is a baby and when their child is a child and so what we know about how how your mother responded to you as a child is also to be a piece of how she responded to you as a baby.\n",
            "Patient: That's interesting. Yeah, that's a good point. People can't just suddenly change when you're four or five.\n",
            "Doctor: So if they're narcissistically preoccupied preoccupied when you're 4 + 5 + 12 + 17 there probably are when you're a baby to even through a snapshot photo shows a moment where they are truly truly are getting narcissistic gratification over this baby. What is it about the baby and getting to know this little person and who is this person going to be or is it about the parents? Is it about her projection into the into the baby about who she wants the baby to be even what the baby means for her?\n",
            "Patient: that's a good point especially with their miscarriage and everything maybe she projected her anger on me or weird feelings or whatever\n",
            "Doctor: so much for the feeling that this better that this one better be\n",
            "Patient: yeah that's opposite but everything is invested in this one kid actually looks more like what it is\n",
            "Doctor: second field in more desperate than and an investment like that would have happened with the first baby to now it's you you're carrying a load for two right away. How long before you was she pregnant for you was did she miscarry?\n",
            "Patient: after me\n",
            "Doctor: It was after you. Okay. Do you know how long after?\n",
            "Patient: No, I think I was in North Carolina. I mean it's definitely before I have a memory. I have no memory at all of her being pregnant or anything like that any so I'm assuming it was before I was five like 4, maybe it was here that I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know if she was trying to have a baby?\n",
            "Patient: I think so. I mean knowing them and knowing that generation very few people were like, let's stop at 1, you know, especially someone like her who isn't who's not competing so much but you definitely cares about what other What others are doing and I don't know any of her friends. I think maybe one two families. Maybe that have one kid, but they all have at least two or three. Her sisters have to her brother has to you know, and also I'm sure my dad had five siblings. I'm sure he wanted one more.\n",
            "Doctor: You told about it because she told you about it years later.\n",
            "Patient: Recently, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But if you had to know about it then to in some way kids pick up these things even toddlers even if you didn't know the didn't know with words.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure it's funny. I was just thinking I didn't make the connection but yesterday was almost a really annoyed. We've been having trouble getting a show locally like yesterday. It really fucking annoyed me like, you know what I forgot. What a fucking clicky, you know. High School Lee fucking saying this town is with indie-rock. It's like everybody and their friends just getting each other shows. It's all it is same couple of bands. Just rotating. I wonder if it's somehow connected if it's connected somehow, that's really been on my mind. That's like what the fuc or even New York Lakeside only I'm not hearing any news from any venues. I don't know. It's been kind of annoying.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you say you didn't get in the show like a specific one? You've been trying to get into?\n",
            "Patient: No, well, I've been pushing to get a show that hasn't and that hasn't happened. I've been pushing to get the CD release party together and that's like not happening. It's just like, you know, it's remind me of how you used to feel with my first. I've always had the slightly antagonistic which works for me and I think that's good. I don't want to be so in the scene or whatever, but now it's getting a little bit annoying like I mean, we got to play shows. I mean it doesn't make sense to you or it doesn't make sense for it to be this difficult. It's about really annoyed me yesterday. I was like, fuck me and fuck these people. Because it really is. like it's just a click and I've been out of the scene for a long time and even Back, then I wasn't really I was but I wasn't you know what I mean? I wasn't really so but like I said, I kind of like it like that to thrive a little bit on being that because I know how good music is so I know it will feel better to make them come around instead of I'm not going to Kowtow to any to anybody. It's just fucking annoying. But even that's weird like I went to Guitar Center yesterday. I got like I'm setting myself up at home to be able to do better record. So that's the weird thing like I do, you know what I mean? That's kind of where I don't get this week like things are good. You know what? I mean? Where is I feel like in the past all this annoying when I feel annoyed. Generally I point at things and say well this isn't going well. This isn't going well. I don't have a girlfriend. I know I know, you know, I know. I you know what? I mean. I don't have that now. I don't know this morning. I woke up. I wrote a bunch of bills. I you know, I don't know. I had a breakfast, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know. I don't.\n",
            "Doctor: What what are you saying?\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm saying I don't get this week in particular why it's been so.\n",
            "Doctor: sad\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I kind of sad and mostly aggravated. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder if I aggravated is easier to feel than sad feels like there's so much sadness aggravated.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe yeah, I mean, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised they say isn't anger just like sadness or something.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, especially if your anger is about feeling shut out or feeling like an outsider or feeling being encroached upon or just not being able to be left alone peacefully and intended to peacefully I think there's also as you're having those experiences right now, I'm emotional experiences about things happening out there that you're stating to be aware of really aren't quite about those things. There's a lot of sadness that was up next to that aggravation because because it's you're aware of having been having been happened already that you were feeling this as a kid. When you were encroached upon as a kid or treated as an outsider. Felt like you're alone in your own family. At least you just want some peace and quiet space. You can be a part of the family. You know, this is evidently sitting there alone. And even you don't get sometimes to know someone will take care of you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think that's true.\n",
            "Doctor: Even me sometimes you show up here and it feels like I'm not taking care of you. I made appointments to close together starting you a couple minutes late, even when I'm even when I'm feeling you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. Is it bad or like my band can't go on tour without me or like all these things? I like either have to end up. Doing a loner. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: If it sounds like it's boiling down to the feeling that while really at the end of the day, I'm alone. That's not really anybody that's going to there's not really anybody that's going to be there.\n",
            "Patient: And maybe that's why I'm seeing you tomorrow and maybe that's what's happening. It's like when I feel this whatever aggravated and angry or sad or whatever. Is that feeling like? Yeah, put, you know brace yourself because I'm sure something will go wrong. It won't work out or like this is gender something. I don't know what the feeling is, but\n",
            "Doctor: Were you feeling that way here Monday? Do you remember anything about being here there I stated. started some way\n",
            "Patient: Noah started Tuesday. I saw a really crazy dream Monday night and Tuesday. I literally woke up in this in this never happened. I woke up feeling kind of just Melancholy and fly just wasn't feeling it. Tuesday was a weird day.\n",
            "Doctor: What was the dream what's so important?\n",
            "Patient: The dream was I was in a bar and made friends with an NBA player whose in a In a bar who's also in movies.\n",
            "Doctor: a man or a woman\n",
            "Patient: Man, I think he's a white guy. I'm not sure but super nice. Like we can't we can't really type friends or something really nice person. And then from there I somehow got two checks in each check was for 99 Grand. Then I remember I was like, so it was not a bad dream. I was happy that I had this friend. I was pretty happy. I got two checks for 99 Grand whatever been a sort of change then I'm driving and I don't know where I was. I don't know. It seems like the South but I didn't know the highway or whatever and I was just driving in there. Is either a laptop or TV in the car with Netflix on order movies? It was just one recurring thing. I having dreams which is that I am either running or driving and I'm fucking sleepy. So I'm driving and I'm almost are Jake and feeling weird. Whatever. I'm also trying to watch blippi on the TV, I think but the thing about it was it was beautiful like it was this very easy autumn. So the trees are still very Lush but they're changing colors and I think the sunlight with you. It was beautiful. It was really really awesome. So then I turned off the road. And it was like a college of some kind of college and there weren't a lot of people there there were hardly any people there and then I ran into my friend and told me that she wanted to become a doctor. She said you want to go to medical school and I was like great. I think I gave her some tips on grad school or something and that was it. Oh then after I was talking to her I saw two women who were from a Siri or something. So I kind of chatted with them in a Syrian but again, it wasn't None of it was nightmarish are stressful. Only Parts. I didn't like were because of this point of my dream. I hear recognize. Here we go. Again. I'm trying to drive. I can't keep my eyes open and I'm exhausted. But other than that, it was like really beautiful. I don't know but I woke up when I was like, I was just super I just woke up down.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you remember more about the feeling and how you're thinking about dreams or part of the dreams?\n",
            "Patient: When I woke up.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, were you sad?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, definitely felt a little bit discombobulated a little bit. That's why I immediately wrote it down. And I was like what the fuck was that all about?\n",
            "Doctor: My guess would be a lot you don't entirely know all of it, but it's pretty Avoca. Do I mean for 1 just to progression from friends with NBA players getting checks in the mail to driving and sleepy driving and watching Netflix. It's sort of like it sort of feels like it's coming from big dream to kind of ordinary experience when you run into a friend and she's going to medical school and you're saying that that's good for you, but you're not\n",
            "Patient: I guess huh? Yeah. Yeah, that was part of the dream. I don't understand. I don't know what that was all about. It was so beautiful and peaceful.\n",
            "Doctor: But it's not NBA and big checks either.\n",
            "Patient: I guess yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It just sounds more real.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, and I don't know why I'm always I can't drive without feeling awful.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you mean that in your dreams or do you mean literally waking?\n",
            "Patient: No. No, I mean that you know, like someone some people have recurring dreams. I don't have any any of that. The only recurring thing I have my dreams. The only thing I can. Never ever be in a car driving and not feeling like shit. I always feel like shit. Like I literally will be swerving like you can't keep my eyes open. It's a really awful feeling. Now, I don't know if this started after DUI thing, you know, maybe.\n",
            "Doctor: I wouldn't say so.\n",
            "Patient: No, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean, it's such a metaphor right? I don't know.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Yeah, I guess well just because I don't remember having this recurring dream for years and years and years. It feels relatively just in the in the last few years then again, I never used to remember my dreams. So who the hell knows but yeah, that's the thing not so much even running really it really is driving. Throw your water driving and awful driving or else I feel like shit in the past would rationalize. like well, maybe it's because I'm snoring so I'm actually not sleeping well and\n",
            "Doctor: Where is I'm thinking the struggle of being in the driver seat and driving forward initiative you figured that in that space you feel like you're in charge of but then it feels then it feels like it fears off and it gets confusing or get sticky again.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think it's I'm trying to get somewhere, but I don't feel completely. It's as if the car is driving me. I don't know what road I'm on. I can't usually right. I usually I can usually not recognize anything.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not an agent with initiative and clarity.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's because yeah, it's not like okay. I'm going to get in the car and go see Dave or I'm going to get in the car and drive to the coast. or I'm suddenly in the forest and where it's beautiful, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: till tomorrow\n",
            "Patient: 310\n",
            "Doctor: 310\n",
            "Patient: Thanks, Tricia Sia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Tell me what's new.\n",
            "Patient: I'm feeling pretty proud of myself right now. I woke up this morning and I was really not doing well. I slept 2 hours later than I meant to because I wake up and I'd be like I can't get up. I can't do this and then go back to bed and set my alarm for another half an hour. I'm sure James really likes that he's pretty good about it. I couldn't get started. I was wanting to hurt myself and was doing really bad. I kind of sat there and thought well, my therapist would probably say that this was something about feeling this way sucks, but it's millier. So it kind of comfort for me. I don't know about that. I thought well, it is comfortable in the sense that as long as I am incapacitated like this. I don't have to figure out what to do next. I can kind of I can say kind of this isn't really my fault. I don't have to think. Okay. What do I do? If I don't have a job? I don't have to actually solve the problem. I was thinking about anything else. That was all I've been thinking about for the last couple of days. I thought okay, and then I felt better.\n",
            "Doctor: How about that?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, go figure.\n",
            "Doctor: I bet that was helpful good for you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, the problem I have is that now I have basically a month of waiting because I've applied to all of the positions. There aren't going to be very many positions being posted because most schools do their contract renewal somewhere around spring break or earlier like in February or early March and so they post new openings in February or March.\n",
            "Doctor: I see you applied for.\n",
            "Patient: I've applied for basically all of the positions that I would be a good fit for and are ones that I want to apply for.\n",
            "Doctor: About how many is that?\n",
            "Patient: about 20 I think yeah, people will have last-minute positions open, but those are going to be far and few between usually what happens as far as I can tell is the hiring committee meet sometime in late March or early April figure out who they want to interview and then call those people. So now I basically have to sit for the next month and see if anybody calls me. So that's going to be hard.\n",
            "Doctor: That sounds like fun.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah. I have pretty much the same conversation with James once a week where I'm so anxious that I'm like well maybe I should just drop this all together and look at other fields, like look for a different job altogether James always says well if you take a full-time job, you won't be able to teach next year. If you get a call you won't be able to take it. You can't do it. I think my job for at least the next month is kind of to keep my anxiety under control. Which you know, that's kind of a full-time job. Too bad. I don't get paid for that. Yeah. I feel like I'm getting better at it though.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, this morning sounds pretty different from how it often goes.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's like the last couple of days it kept getting worse and worse. And worse but I also kept feeling like I just needed something to snap me out of it and I wasn't able to find that. Yeah. I'm sure there is more to it. Then. I suddenly felt better. But that's kind of what it felt like. I think it was that I hadn't looked at it that way and then said, okay. Well, that's the case then. I mean, I don't know whether that's true or not. But if I act like that's true, then the next thing for me to do is figure out what I'm going to do next and say book. No, I actually have to figure out what I have to do next. But I talked to James again and said no, I pretty much just have to keep doing the same thing. It's not time for me to decide that I failed at this yet.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Give it another month then we'll decide on it together.\n",
            "Doctor: Which seriously is sort of the same movie again, isn't it? Like well, what I've got to do is instead of deciding preemptively that I failed at this so I don't have to sit around being anxious about whether it failed or not. I'm going to sit around and be anxious. In other words. The move is to kind of admit defeat in order to get out of an actual situation. You kind of Stave it off or Ward it off again. Do you know what I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, ya know it's like Now I just get to be anxious hooray. I read an article a friend of mine writes about he basically writes about culture for a lot of little magazines and I did desus and he's a very good writer W. Like I wrote this and I'll read it. He wrote about a show that I've never seen girls which apparently is a Big Show and the reading it I was like, it's just like sex in the city and Gossip Girl only better. I was like, okay. I really don't want to see the show now. Not really my thing. He was talking about anxiety and describing having a panic attack the other night. I think he ended on was he said anxiety tends to Cripple us and keep us in her harness and keep us from relating to people and he was from looking outside ourselves, but it can also be this thing that spreads to connect with other people and to write to figure things out. I kind of had to look back through the rest of the article because I was like, I don't see the second part at all.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I don't find that anxiety. Does that for me? I think what he was saying is that he saw his connection to the anxiety of the character on the show and it spurred him to write that article. Anyway, I don't know. I feel like my depression and anxiety just makes me worse person consistently. certainly more selfish person I reread the end of the affair yesterday. I told my sister that's what I was reading. And she said are you sure that's a good book for you to be reading when you're having a bad day?\n",
            "Doctor: I've never read that.\n",
            "Patient: It's Graham Greene. I've read it before but I forgotten everything about it. It's about this man who had an affair with this woman. It's set just post World War II in London. if they're mostly took place during the war, she broke it off with him completely unexpectedly a year-and-a-half ago and he's basically been greeting her existence ever since The terrible person so he's super jealous of her and hates her and takes her husband is hiring a private detective to track her because he thinks she's sleeping with somebody else now. I forgotten that it's essentially a book about God Graham Greene was a convert to Catholicism. I picked it up because I was reading a biography of for American Catholic writers. It's a really good book. Anyway, it's about God and it's about suffering. It's pretty theological as it turns out. It's about God as both a suffering God and someone who's with you and your suffering kind of the Redemptive qualities of suffering. So it's like okay not seeing this. I know it's Easter. So that's basically all we're going to be talking about for the next six weeks the suffering God basically the Theology of suffering.\n",
            "Doctor: because of the crucifixion\n",
            "Patient: Yes. Yes, if you believe Jesus Is God what does it mean to have a God who suffers with you etcetera that turns into you. There are a lot of really terrible field agents out there.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Every priest has to give a sermon every Parish Priest. Some people are really good at sermons and some people are really not good at them. I'm both picky and kind of skeptical about things. I feel like one of sermons are good. So anyway, a lot of people end up talking about suffering as something that is a good thing or it sure sounds like they're talking about suffering as a good thing. Maybe they're not trying to say that but that's what they end up saying by accident. I don't really feel like this is done me any good.\n",
            "Doctor: I would imagine that implications of it pissed you off.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Partly because it sucks to be misunderstood and partly. I'm just like why am I doing this wrong? Yeah sermons in general tend to piss me off to be honest.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, really?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, you know I really like going to church in some ways. I've no idea why I actually believe and it's still very you don't find very many priests were comfortable admitting that they don't know. We're comfortable talking about things that they don't know. You got a lot of complacent certainty. It is difficult for me to Deal with even when I'm not depressed. It's always difficult for me to deal with. My sister is the same way actually which is funny because she works at church. She forms people form young Christians. She's getting confirmed which is like you get baptized as an infant and then at least in Episcopalian and I think in Catholicism and I'm sure in some other religions, but you get confirmed as a young adult is like entering into an adult relationship with the church and saying I affirm these things this is who I want to be and this is where I want to be Do usually get confirmed when you're like 13 not when he cheats the confirmation class. When she was in 8th grade, she went through it through the confirmation class because you know, you're the priest kid and my dad taught it and then she said I'm not getting confirmed. I don't believe I'm not doing it. I think my dad was not super happy about that. I think she pretty much past due now. Sorry. I was wondering\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe you're a little anxious to be mad and critical.\n",
            "Patient: yeah. Usually I'm pretty comfortable being mad and critical at the sermons. I have been kind of the skeptic in the feudal for a long time. But on this topic, I'm anxious about it. I would really like this to mean something but I just don't think it does.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you mean by its meaning something in other words? I guess one of the things that occurs to me is one sort of meeting which is often the way we talk about it is more. Like how does it work when you feel bad does it do this? What does that do in a way that seems like one kind of meeting but then there's something else which is ratified by anything Redemptive about what's going on. We're just talking about how it works. There's also meaning something which I think is often true in this context that there's something Redemptive in the suffering. I'm not sure which one you're referring to which sort of meaning it lacks or maybe both.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I feel like we talked a lot about how this works how it happens and the first kind of meeting what triggers it how it plays out. I guess I'm talking more about why is this happening to me? Why is this my life? I guess it's got to be the question everybody asks, and so I guess it makes me angry to hear people offer answers that are to me clearly not the case. I hear a lot of suffering will bring you closer to God and I hear a lot of suffering will help you be a better person understand other people better or be closer to other people. I don't feel like either those are the case. I feel like I just get more and more alone and less and less capable of seeing anything outside of myself.\n",
            "Doctor: I agree that for you. That's often true. I don't mean to make a larger point about suffering but one more local to you, which is yeah, I think mostly what I hear is depression and anxiety had making more isolated and when you're suffering the most you're suffering along usually\n",
            "Patient: But that doesn't have to be the case for everybody. I don't know you're going there or not.\n",
            "Doctor: I think part of what that is for you which may not address the kind of broader issue, but it's for you for the moment forgetting who's responsible for this you rarely been able to share your suffering with people around with him, you might\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I very often do you like when I'm doing badly and I talk to somebody about it at the end of it. I sort of feel like great now. We're both unhappy awesome.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think this is the part of the kind of background noise or background radiation. Where is like, when am I going to get sick and tired of frustrated with caring about how bad it is?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, particularly when the last couple of days there's nothing really new to say it's pretty much the same thing happening. It kind of happens over and over and over. Yeah, I feel like James gets frustrated with me about that or I worry about that. I feel like well if my life sucks, at least it should suck a new way. Or if it sucks in the same way I should be able to come up with something to do about it. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's kind of an indication or an illustration of how much you feel like you can really suffer. You had better be by yourself because nobody really wants to hear it or at least not for very long.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: so if you're suffering and means you're going to be by yourself\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: which again is probably some broader existential question but I'm not intending\n",
            "Patient: No, it's okay.\n",
            "Doctor: clearly\n",
            "Patient: I talked to my sister on the phone yesterday and I was doing pretty badly. She was having a good day. I didn't want to go into too much detail about not doing well because then I start crying on the phone and all of those things. Where I was going with this is that from me when I'm with somebody when I'm suffering. I can't think about the other person at all. I can't enter the other person's life. I can't talk about the things that the other person wants to talk about. It's like I don't have anything to give that sucks. I feel terrible about that. We talked for a little bit and she told me all about what was going on with her and then there was just silence. I told her what was going on and that I was having a bad day and that I was anxious about finding a job and haven't heard back from anywhere etcetera Etc. But to try to summarize why I'm not doing well takes about 30 seconds. And then I just have the same things to say over and over and over again. That's all I've got. It's like this huge giant thing for me that's blocking out everything else.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, actually my suspicion is that you're sort of in the Middle Ground there. When I first heard you say it was like I bet that's more than you might have shared some time in the past to say that you're having a bad day and given more or less overview.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, that's a lot more and to think that I'm having a bad day.\n",
            "Doctor: But there probably is a lot more you could say that doesn't occur to you because again, you kind of don't want to go there. I'm not suggesting that I think you should go there. But what I'm interested in is that it doesn't even occur to you that there's more to the story such as you always get down and feel like you haven't been a good enough job, which is how you feel when you haven't gotten a job, which is part of why you're feeling so bad. You're probably also thinking about suicide in a way that's a release. There's any way it feels crummy and you're probably worried about staying in this really downward Jag after having felt better for a while and that sucks.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: there may be other things too I just know these are things that you often I have often thought and again I'm not saying you want to be telling your sister but it doesn't matter to you that there's more to the story second\n",
            "Patient: No, I was just going to agree with you. That is interesting. After we talked about jobs and what to do what I should be doing for the next month. She said let's not wait another week and a half before we had this conversation because he just do four days and then we talked about it. Let's just talk about it before you starts doing that's an idea. I'm worried about trying your patience. A lot more about trying James's patience. Yeah, I don't know why it doesn't occur to me. I don't know. We always have these weird conversations. Like hey, how are you doing? I'm not doing so well. I'm kind of having a bad day. How are you doing? She talks for 15 minutes about her dog. It's like I'm pretty good at keeping the focus off of myself and then feel kind of resentful about it, which doesn't help.\n",
            "Doctor: You're in a difficult situation where it's hard to be in touch with yourself and hurt at the same time. I don't know. Maybe she was more in touch with you that way or has been consistent in responding.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It's like we can either have the conversation about me or we can have the conversation about her. It doesn't feel like both can happen in the same conversation.\n",
            "Doctor: icing\n",
            "Patient: So I can either tell her what my life is actually like right now or in order to listen to her at all. I sort of have to pretend that the rest of my life doesn't exist. I have to pull out of it yesterday. I just couldn't do that. Yeah, I guess I also don't know what else to say to her because I told her how it is. I mean, she's somebody I really trust somebody. I'm really close to maybe it's too scary. Or I feel like if I tell her that she will have to deal with this too. And it's don't want that. I think that's it. I guess part of me is like I'd rather be alone in this than having other people hurting like this. But I also sort of want other people to be. With me so clearly part of me wants other people to feel like this and I feel bad about that. Somehow it doesn't occur to me. I'm not that good of a storyteller. You know, I'm not going to give this to other people by talking about it.\n",
            "Doctor: I see it feels a little like smite.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, if you look exactly like I will.\n",
            "Doctor: IC contagious\n",
            "Patient: Yeah clearly.\n",
            "Doctor: we should finish up.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hello.\n",
            "Patient: Good morning.\n",
            "Doctor: So we started couples counseling last week, but we're still feeling out. Dr. Janice to figure out if he's the right person or not.\n",
            "Patient: that session actually started with a recount of what's going on why we're here, you know as it might reasonably start with I guess how we got there isn't really the issue. But at some point Tanya disclose that she was still suicidal on a regular basis like multiple times a week. I suggested that that have been true for that. It had never not been true. You know, it sounds ridiculous. But I think I don't think she's correct about that. I think there was a. Of time where it certainly was not every couple or three days or something. I'm not sure that's really the important point though. I don't know exactly what to say about that other than that happened. So\n",
            "Doctor: Well clearly it was deeply upsetting.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean I've been living with her for a while. You know on the one hand, I'm not surprised in the context of the last several weeks. I think I mentioned that I had. I think I mentioned that I thought she had not been doing that. Well while I was gone. I mean that's not such big of a surprise they claim that it's like an unbroken string back to March or whatever. I'm not sure it really matters, but I think I feel like I should have a general sense of that and often I do without her saying anyting just living with her. I guess I also feel like you're not telling me is a sign of her not trusting me to do something or handle something just is what it is.\n",
            "Doctor: It could be that it could also be that she doesn't want to further burden you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, or it could be she suggested that she thought she told me or that I knew I'm not really sure that that's not reasonable. But yeah, I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Did it make you feel discouraged?\n",
            "Patient: I sure sound discouraged don't I?\n",
            "Doctor: You do.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah talking about it's making me feel discouraged or at least it's that the emotion that's bubbling up. Yeah, I think probably that sounds about right. This incentive like here we go again. Yeah, I think on any particular day when she's not well I can either handle it just fine or I feel like there's nothing in that we're going to do today. That's any different from the last time we did exactly the same day and nothing's changed. So Realistically, I think she's coping with it better in the sense that if the claim is true. She's been off and on suicidal for several months without being hospitalized. So that's probably good. Certainly, her mood has not been as dire as it has been in most of the hospitalization circumstances cuz it's obvious when her mood is that bad? Yeah, I think discouraged. It's right. I don't have a very clear sense of here's a strategy that will win out in the end. Just keep doing this. I'll come here. She'll see Josh. Go to couples counseling. She'll still be suicidal. Yeah, I think discouraged is right.\n",
            "Doctor: Well ultimately for you to feel I don't know if okay is the right word. I'll use OK more than just okay, but is one of two options and I'm talking about not tomorrow, but sort of ultimately that you feel like your vows to her are the thing that's most important to you because that's who you are. And you do love her and you'll see what needs in this marriage can be met and the needs you can't get mad at you in some way and find satisfaction in your life the best you can or not the best you can but in other areas and sort of acknowledge the limitations of your marriage or you decide to leave her and even though you're extremely important as the she you want a better life with somebody else with more potential and LS angst-ridden existence that just builds resentment. And those are one of the two options that will ultimately make you happier. To put it in a nutshell.\n",
            "Patient: fair enough\n",
            "Doctor: What are you thinking?\n",
            "Patient: I would just say that was a really good thing to say. Yeah, I think it's right there are two fairly obvious and points that. None of which is ideal necessary. But this is the real world. Whatever.\n",
            "Doctor: No, neither is ideal and both have unpleasant and disappointing aspects to them for sure.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, and the pasta neither is necessarily smooth or happy but\n",
            "Doctor: Write the former is a more internal process. The path is more internal and the ladder is internal but more external as well my saying that comes from feeling that that's true. Also, wets framing it is that you're not trapped. You have a choice you have choices. The third option is to go on the way you're going on and I'm not suggesting that you should ultimately that you should choose tomorrow pick up. The sort of in the long run is to feel angry and trapped and maybe over time is that. That's an option. It would be an unfortunate one for you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I want the framing that you gave because it so that's not really an option in the original setup. Right? You said eventually you will feel okay in one of these two set.\n",
            "Doctor: Right exactly.\n",
            "Patient: I thought you framed the entire thing very very carefully and there was a whole lot packed into it and I liked it. Yeah, there was a great deal about acceptance and lost built into the two paths. circling around repeating what you said sort of so it was very freeing to hear the first time. You know, something's just rang very very true. And that was one of them. Like I said, it was very well trained and I'm just yeah, those are the I don't know points in the distance and some cents. So then I think something like that and how it's helpful and free and then I think about the question or the it will occur to me that that was the right thing to say if such a thing exists. So then it's well, how did you know it was the right thing to say right then then I will think about this moment when you asked me what are you thinking about? And I say that and then you would usually then respond something like you wonder how I came to this and I said, yes and then we talk about something else. That's our pattern.\n",
            "Doctor: I see right, right. Got it.\n",
            "Patient: And then I try to think about the other things since that's not going to go anywhere. It's so I want to think about something else. Yeah, I think I'd like uncertainty to be bounded and I think that's more or less the correct bounding on uncertainty. I certainly don't know where we'll end up or where I will end up. But yeah, the space is marked in some way or something. So I'm going to a conference next week and making a poster. I finished the poster last night. Making process is so exciting to sing for me because I don't like making mistakes and I don't like correcting it in large letters when there are mistakes. So I'm very careful not to make mistakes, but there's also like oh, I don't know some not well defined apprehension about the experience of presenting the poster. So one of the main ways I combat guys to think about the other conference that I went to where the things I was talking about. I was not particularly pleased with the work. I mean, I was pleased when they got to the point they had gotten to But like it was mostly the things we were trying really don't work and they don't work for these reasons. What is a vaguely depressing experience very depressing experience, but big least satisfying to be able to bury it in that way. But I found that it was well-received experience was vaguely awkward because you don't know anybody but it's fine. So I can fairly well predict what it's going to be like even though I've never been to this particular conference. I guess I'm am used to have you do the same thing that I would do if I were trying to manage the emotion or deal with it or something. It was nice although And then I hadn't really, you know, we get to this point to the sessions and they have been sort of randomly distributed across sessions and in the time-space of a session break one of us will get on something true. Usually it's you will refer formulate everything into a concise whole very nicely and then I don't have much more to say then yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And how do you feel about that? I mean you're saying yes you agree, but then what are the feelings attached?\n",
            "Patient: Strangely comfort and joy, like delighted by the process that we went through there. I find it amusing that that was how it went. But I'm also really pleased that that was very nice and I really appreciate you doing what you do and saying what you said. Yeah, I think it's comforting to have the problem understood thoroughly and the long-range answer to it described in careful detail. You're not painting Rosie pictures and any sense, but other pictures where things are. Okay, and they'll descriptions were how to get there in a long-term scale sense. I think how does that make me feel so that I can sort of dwell on what it might look like to go along the path, you know to think about the intervening time between here and there and where everything either stands a beam and none of it is And I know that it had sorrow and hardship and all of that attached. But yeah, it's okay because it's going somewhere.\n",
            "Doctor: I've had a couple of other thoughts in one is and we talked about this before all of your experiences disillusionment in your life and how just deeply disturbing that is and has been for you the other thought I had that maybe as part of I could see you why what I said could be comforting for several reasons, but that you know you so hope for ideal situations and so many ways that idea that things could be good. Even if they're not ideal. I think it's a very nice for you to feel that would be very very nice.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Was that meant as a recommendation?\n",
            "Doctor: What what I said?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I guess how do you define recommendation?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess the question is something like was that a more prescriptive or more a descriptive statement that it would be really nice for me to feel things that are good even if not ideal.\n",
            "Doctor: It was a descriptive statement that implicitly it was prescriptive.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: It was certainly descriptive.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: And I think when I think of prescriptive I think of this is what you should do, but I think it would be more accurate my saying this is what I want for you because I think this would be good which is a little bit different.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Some people often use they describe situations as non-ideal that are really bad. Do you mean those also\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not sure. I understand what you're saying, but I'm not sure what you're referring to.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so you you suggested that you would want for me to feel good about situations that are not ideal. Is the non ideal intentionally unbounded there?\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, seeing equating non-ideal descriptions with situations that are bad is exactly the problem of trying to address. I want to decouple that Association.\n",
            "Patient: Because look.\n",
            "Doctor: Hey.\n",
            "Patient: No, I hadn't appreciated having that quick Insight. I think. I think that's a hard problem.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and it shows up in so many areas of your life. You talked about it with respect to your career and how the option seems bad because there were some I don't want to say fundamental flaws but flies. Yeah, well as in problem and that they were not ideal.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, we dealt with this in several different conversations. Also in the sense that like this is definitely related to the of something in the sense that\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: We're all going to die. What does ideal even mean in that context? Or bounded in the vastness of time and space and what sense does a small concept of Ideal? How does that fit their? But I think I normally make a distinction between ideal and like some range of okay and then some other range of really not. Okay. So like then I guess I don't know. I'm not sure. It's a yeah, I guess I need some argumentation that it is a reasonable task to try to get rid of the category of not. Okay. Like I don't really think you would argue with that, you know using chemical weapons in Syria was a good thing or an okay thing.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, I don't want to get rid of the category not okay. I certainly hope I didn't mean to imply that at all.\n",
            "Patient: No, I didn't really take you to be but that was what I was asking you if you left. not ideal unbounded Although the bottom floor not ideal is really bad.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, and I think I was more commenting that and listening to you. Not ideal is off an equivalent was not okay or not. Come sing a broader range.\n",
            "Patient: You may be right you listen to me and you listen very very well. In some circumstances. I feel like I'm drawing a line where this is. Okay, and this is not okay like any use of chemical warfare not okay. but then I might say something as ideally in order to use chemical weapons, which I don't think you really disagree with but\n",
            "Doctor: Well, ideally you would have married the person that you thought you married and she wouldn't be suicidal and she would embrace the same values that you have and that's ideal. That's not going to happen. So within that what are the possibilities for you, that's the so I guess the equivalent of if nobody's going to use chemical weapons then what can you do with in those options people feel trapped when they feel that none of their options are okay, then you're trapped. So the question is how can we make the options available to you? Okay, and then in that you actually probably could see more good at each of them then if a parent right now. You know, I'd like to know more about what you're thinking, but I'm going to need to wait 2 weeks to I didn't mean to disturb your referee.\n",
            "Patient: No, that's okay. Thanks very much.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so I will see you in two weeks.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Good luck next week at your conference.\n",
            "Patient: It'll go fine.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sure it will all right.\n",
            "Patient: Bye.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Come on Inn.\n",
            "Patient: How are you?\n",
            "Doctor: Good. Thank you.\n",
            "Patient: You don't take spring break.\n",
            "Doctor: spring break from\n",
            "Patient: Are you now? It's spring break this week. Everything looks dead. Hahaha. It doesn't.\n",
            "Doctor: from college\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: am I in college?\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm just saying good. Not that it feels like spring out today. It feels dull because no one's around and yeah, and I think it would be pretty unhappy if I wasn't in college life if I wasn't part of something big with a lot of people walking, hahaha. I kind of had a I guess lately someone interesting experience yesterday. I had to go with David to his chairs for dinner the department head and it was dreading the whole time. Like I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it because usually I mean I always try but I think I spoke about this before when I've been to his professors or friends places. I've always felt awkward. I feel like I've internalized what I felt with them like on Saturday night. His friends came over there a couple they teach with David in the same place and they have to kiss and I felt so awkward the whole time they made me feel so uncomfortable when they were doing anything, but just like it felt. I mean, they're both Economist so they were mostly talking about Is there kids let them they were mostly talking about economics and I don't know what to say and you know, they tried to ask me question. What are you doing? How are you doing? It feels so weird. Hahaha, but yesterday after her place the chairs place I was driving it. But as soon as I walked into her house, she said I've been renting this place for a long time and you know, it was a single mom so immediately I felt like I can be myself. And yeah, I was I enjoyed I talked a lot. I was very unselfconscious and like when she asked me what I was doing and David always tells me I never answer that question. I'm very cryptic Word answers that don't inspire people to ask anymore. But I as soon as she asked me if I gave her every new thing that could be someone would say what I was doing where I was studying. I had no shame because usually I would be very ashamed like them Professor me student. Hahaha, but I wasn't so I told her and I realised because like all his friend are so full of themselves. They're so sure there's no certain and I don't feel comfortable at all with them like they come. Family background so, you know there's a class difference what I feel and then you know a gender difference for house. They just look very sure of themselves and very they have it all together and I don't see any sign of distress. You can't when you meet somebody the first time still I mean last night I thought you can perhaps you know, so I thought that was interesting and then David and I were talking about marriage last night about how I don't want to get married and I I don't know we talked about a relationship but I've been I've not been feeling like talking to him at all or like I didn't want to tell him all those things as directly as I did last night just because it seems like you know couldn't do it, but I know basically like we were saying that so he was like, why don't you want to get married and I was like, no. He said something like to me marriage just means that it's the commitment you're saying to someone that you want to be with them for the rest of your life. So I was like, yeah, that sounds pretty nice, but I still don't feel like seeing that to you. You just don't Inspire that kind of passion, you know, like I feel like that statement should be full of, you know, strong emotion and you just don't Inspire strong emotion, you know, you're pretty Call Kirsten and I haven't shared my emotional side with you or when I have Shady about the responses like you no crickets or something, you know, it's hard for that to say that feel that you know, not that I haven't felt that with other people. I have you no other things have happened that made us not be together for the rest of our lives. But I was saying, you know, I mean, it's not I don't think that we shouldn't be together. Although in the back of my head. I was like, oh that's pretty true. But but like, you know trying to be with him has required me to change a lot, you know, like, you know, like when you said that I speak here is basically, you know, it's either David things this way so I should think this way or David thinks this way. So I want to do the opposite so he's always a center and I'm always doing everything with respect to him most of the time right? I mean, that's an unusually preoccupied. So to be with you I figured that the only thing I could do is to be preoccupied myself all the time and we can have life and we can share those things. We can cook together. We can play Angry Birds, you know, hahaha and and that that's what I said as I mean not not like Passionate or not really emotional or not adventurous or not explain the world together and he didn't say much. He wasn't like well he did say when I said, you know, you're thinking has become like the rules. So I was like that sounds bad, but he wasn't like therefore we should break up or therefore block, you know, it wasn't like\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not sure. I understand. Your thinking has become the rule for me. I don't know what that means.\n",
            "Patient: like, you know, like I was telling him that I always think you know, what would you think in this area?\n",
            "Doctor: I see you said that to him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so he was like, that's bad.\n",
            "Doctor: How did how did he respond to your saying, you know you don't Inspire passion in me?\n",
            "Patient: Nothing, I think on later. He said like you disappoint me too. And I was like, oh, but at first he was like, yeah, I know it's General disappointment satisfaction when the other person is he was like you never say hi to my parents when they come on Skype. So I was like, well blah blah blah blah blah. I try really hard to be to connect with you your mom and she and I we just don't connect and you know, she's like you she's not all emotional. I mean, she's so unemotional to the extent that won her 98 year old mother passed away. She the David's mom was in India and when David's mom's mom was in a different place in the country and we were there. So how did like talk to her on the phone for like an hour to convince her to come to for her mom's funeral and she then came and her brother had organized issue. No, thanks for that their mom and you know, he was crying. He was like this very very tough guy and see how to make a speech or something. So she was just very very awkward. She just said I'm here. It's nice to be here. Thank you. I understand. She had a difficult time when he was younger. She did she's with her mom, but you don't feel anything really like you really can't think back on any not any instance of how your mom said you loved or aren't you sad? You know, how long after me a lot like you and it just made its the cultural or whatever, but I know women how can you be like that? Maybe I shouldn't say that just as you know, where is saddened by your mother's passing, you know, but anyway, we try to we just don't connect. I mean she really she reads a lot. And all but then you know that statement of her she made years ago writing is a luxury when I was trying to be become a writer that really hurt me and I think I'm holding on to that and not forgiving her for that. So so\n",
            "Doctor: I just I mean it seems like you had a very important conversation with him last night telling him you're actually not interested in marriage.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: May seem like a big thing. She kind of okay. Well next topic.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's like that. That's how it is. I mean, that's what I mean about not connecting emotionally. It seems no motion can be significant enough to make a difference, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel you're with him because you're afraid to be alone.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, there's several reasons. I mean I'm using him to pay my mom's rent. The other concern is what do I do if I want to go to India and I'm realizing that I could possibly find a cheaper place in those are I mean, I'm sure there are other spaces like probably I don't like to share a place with a lot of people but I don't know I'm just gotten very comfortable to use that excuse has a nice place and and we like each other we have affection. I mean in a way I'm thinking yeah, so actually he brush it aside. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it shows what it shows what his priorities are and I need those priority should be my priorities. I know, you know like moving on with work, you know.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't understand. He said that he had a priority to get married. So I'm not sure what you're referring to.\n",
            "Patient: Run am I mean like him brushing because you said that we had a big conversation and what happened as a result, right?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, well open terms of impact on the two of you and just how you felt about it, too.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like he doesn't do anything if you know the conversation is over in. Let's move on with your date. That's what I think. So maybe I should do that too is what I'm saying, like a cat like his priorities become my priorities are not wearing too much and how to spell and you know.\n",
            "Doctor: Seems like he's making it clear that this is not what he wants this, you know the sort of going on kind of relationship.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well, he said he's not that Keen on marriage. It's just for his parents sake. Now I'm so confused because of this. I feel I don't have the guts to change my life situation. And as a result, I'm stepping someone else's priorities with my own. I'm forgetting who I am and what I want but since I have such a strong independent streak, I think I have a strong. I mean I'm about and then I don't find a way to connect emotionally with the most important supposedly most important people in my life. So look for other people or other places and don't find them and then so I continue being miserable. I don't know sad. I mean most people in Academia, they don't have time for emotions, right?\n",
            "Doctor: I see because so many other people as jobs are so easy and they work so few hours. I don't know what that means People magazine Mia.\n",
            "Patient: I mean, they're busy right there very busy.\n",
            "Doctor: A post attorneys who don't do any work. People in business or Finance positions. I don't know. It doesn't seem like a very elite elitist comment.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean you can easily make the argument I could do academics have so much more free time so much more flexible time than any other job.\n",
            "Patient: That's true. That is true. So, how are the emotional? I'm a loss of\n",
            "Doctor: Did I see what sort of a demon sort of and idealization of Academia univ academics as Beneath The Fray other plebeians have time for emotions, but not academics.\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm not trying to I mean, I'm sure it's not be but here I'm not trying to defend them are like, you know eulogized I'm a glorified I'm just saying that and I'm kind of reasoning with myself like saying why you making such a big deal with emotions, you know, most people don't have time for emotions are you know who you really are, you know, so then but then you know, it's the thing that some professions are Maybe I'm Wrong. Yeah, you're right. My something is wrong. I don't know it just feels like as if David does it I'm thinking so it must be like this for a lot of his friends in for the larger community that they just have to work all the time because they have to get 10-year. They have to get published in. So they're mostly just at the computer working and not yeah, but I mean the guy who the friend friends who come on Saturday this week day of the week off and they're skiing somewhere and I'm not saying that emotion, you know, but it is, you know vacation. But David has to be part of a whole bunch of initiative and things to get meaning out of like and I'm trying to do that right now. I'm not saying it's bad. It's probably good for me, but it doesn't mean that I get to you know, it's not all that. I am you know that I'm like, I don't know what I'm trying so hard to change so I may know what I want. It's just that I'm trying to change and so on the process I'm getting confused maybe purposely so\n",
            "Doctor: purposely losing sight\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you think that on purpose Port Isabel?\n",
            "Patient: To be with David to make it work because he keeps saying he loves me and I'm like, I don't know if anyone else could love me, you know, so.\n",
            "Doctor: Why not?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. He's very nice. I'm sure there are there nice people, but it doesn't seem possible.\n",
            "Doctor: What about it doesn't seem possible.\n",
            "Patient: Well, it's going to be as nice as him in a sensitive and straight, you know, and as honest and righteous.\n",
            "Doctor: Is your heart into what you're saying?\n",
            "Patient: my heart\n",
            "Doctor: right now\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: really?\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean heart?\n",
            "Doctor: You seem distracted and you're playing with like. If you're trying to sell something right now, I wouldn't believe the product.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: No need to apologize. I was just pointing out.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, perhaps all this confusion is because of or not. It's always been there but it keeps it comes to the service because of the fact that just emailed me. I still don't get that stupid person. You know, I really should just send him an email saying we cannot be touched for a few years. He was in India for a couple months while still but yeah, he sent me somewhere email. I don't know how I told you this he sent me this weird to email like a month ago or something just like a link of a YouTube video like a song. We had a weird a misogynist Shades. I thought I was like ask David. He saw the email he was like I was like, whatever do you think this means we were listening to the song he was like, well, we just exchanged, you know, very mundane email. How are you? What are you doing? How are your parents would have you seen I was right. Maybe this was a little too revealing in my feelings right. Sounds you revealing or no?\n",
            "Doctor: It depends on well, too revealing means you're revealing more than you want to so.\n",
            "Patient: I don't want to reveal so yeah, but if I say, I just want to see the city Through Your Eyes is that like sport rain or is that\n",
            "Doctor: You feel anxious about your comment to him.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, but I mean he didn't respond for like 20 days or something and then he responded not directly to anyting anything but you just sent me a bunch of pictures of some director Kaweah scan from a book. He was reading. So I also ignored you know, and then this week he wrote back. Did you get the pictures? I was like no go away and then I was like, yeah, I did. Thank you and I meet again started exchanging email. So I mean, it doesn't really damaged play Havoc with my emotions. You know, like I keep thinking maybe there's a chance, you know, I know I shouldn't think that and should move on and how much time is passing all that.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, he certainly awakens this maybe there's a chance for something else.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, it's been a year. Why can't I just get over I guess I was over like until he contacted contact me. I try not to think about it and think less and less then as soon as he does like all of its back. So maybe it's just too soon to know. Maybe it'll take me a couple years.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe it's an antidote to your feelings that no one else could love you. He comes into the picture and you think well, maybe.\n",
            "Patient: I know it can't so.\n",
            "Doctor: But in your relationship with David, you're really coasting.\n",
            "Patient: toasting Azan\n",
            "Doctor: You're not you're not using your driving controls. You're not going in forward reverse breaking your just coasting.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: If it's not on the pedal your foot on the brake, you're just coasting.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think we're both cozy. I don't either of us are driving and are breaking or\n",
            "Doctor: That's very true. But he's not my patient.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I care about his well-being in a general sense, but\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Is psychological growth and development is not my part of my job. I agree with your assessment, but my guess is also that you want something different than this not necessarily even different than him maybe different from him, but certainly different from the relationship you have right now.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And this might be aside from the commitment. Peace. This might be exactly what he wants. This kind of relationship.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think it is. Someone who doesn't take him in any direction the relationship is an autopilot, right? And you can just focus 98% on work and I don't find anything wrong with that. I used to be your God. I found that repulses. Maybe I still have I find it weird, but I've come to appreciate that because I know it takes I know what hard work is so he's cut out for ambitious thing question being as what you know, so\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know people can be very ambitious, but also be deeply connected and emotionally invested in the people around them. You see these things as opposites.\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't. I don't I know they're there are people and I know them. But David is not one of them.\n",
            "Doctor: Will you were saying before well, he's in Academia. So maybe he just doesn't have time.\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm I was still stick by my statement that they don't have a lot of you know, we're almost time to do various said well, maybe they do some of them do but yeah, I don't know. I think it's time to ask my mother to be like, can you find some work even if it's like slightly meaning menial? I mean, I do have this fear that I'll find someone emotional and then it'll turn turn out that I don't want that either. So I'm pretty sure because like last year when I did go out on a few dates, I was always comparing the people to David and find them locking obviously. So I mean what I say emotional emotional emotional cuz it just that I'm too needy and\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, you're way too needy.\n",
            "Patient: it could be true. I mean like I might just be going through a weird phase and you know, if I'm strong enough that I won't need that emotional connection.\n",
            "Doctor: That's wishful thinking.\n",
            "Patient: wishful thinking That were true. Then you wouldn't have had to do anything different. You can just stay with Dave and do what's comfortable. Yeah. Why doesn't he make time for fun things?\n",
            "Doctor: Give us a high-value fun things.\n",
            "Patient: Why not?\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know you could ask him.\n",
            "Patient: I'm tired. I'm really tired of having you know, stupid frivolous conversations with them seven years, and it's not a very ridiculous talking to him about anything on intellectual or just funny and I go with all this you get this answer this. And I know I'm stupid and so\n",
            "Doctor: Like an answer and why he doesn't like fun things.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That was the most emotion I saw it from you today.\n",
            "Patient: What?\n",
            "Doctor: What you just said, I'm sick of this. I don't know. Frustration is more emotion than I saw from you today so far. Say not in general. today not in general\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What I what I said earlier about like I'm not buying this product. I do feel you go into these times where you're trying to sell yourself and me on some life philosophy.\n",
            "Patient: yeah\n",
            "Doctor: And about what you should be able to do without I don't think you're buying you're not a convincing spokesman because you don't buy it either. You're just sort of giving lip service.\n",
            "Patient: maybe that's true I mean I'm not making it up but I I guess it's an objectively appreciate it not emotionally it's like this is a really righteous product it was good sitting there I'm eating with my roommate today and I feel like I want to ask Because like I think a couple people will be moving. So I'll ask who they are and it's an expensive place and I don't like the location but I guess I've seen I found people in the community who had because I think I was telling you right like this mother daughter. So the daughter is you know 36, so if she's old much older than me, like she's she says, you know, she'd rather be alone and you know, and she doesn't mind that and I think maybe I'll be okay with being alone because like several months ago November and December I would not have been able to say that I could be okay with being alone. I'm terrified of that. So but maybe not so much now, I don't know I could distract myself with work, so\n",
            "Doctor: Well and alone is relative because you have a lot of people in your life.\n",
            "Patient: I do.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not sure.\n",
            "Patient: Well, I have like Community people now. I mean, I don't like I mean I care about that. Being but in a general sense, we don't connect emotionally not all the time.\n",
            "Doctor: I was going to say I don't know the word but you certainly have lots of groups. Yeah in your life and you're connected to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: maybe you don't feel like you have a lot of people you're connected to you one-on-one, but I'm not sure that's a\n",
            "Patient: actually\n",
            "Doctor: find when you say that's fun.\n",
            "Patient: well, I like Well, like I I like connections like with my roommate. I definitely have an emotional connection. She and I we get each other like all roommates do like that woman the mother and daughter we connect emotionally, but also is Alexa\n",
            "Doctor: She said you pie.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it's funny. I want to keep reading down just so I can be nurtured like that.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe it'll have to break down to be nurtured like that.\n",
            "Patient: What is real fun that intensity? It's fun, but it's also ridiculously embarrassing.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, maybe that's what makes you feel needy because you feel like that's the only way to sort of generate that kind of connection.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess if I get more that, you know on regular basis, maybe I won't feel like breaking down all the time.\n",
            "Doctor: I kind of people feel nurtured without the sense of desperation or urgency.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Getting a piece of pie everyday.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe not every day every week. Yeah. I don't know about David does it maybe he's just a very strong person. But I feel like I want that proverbial and literal piece of pie like he doesn't you see him right like read them. Literally he's right then and he has no not much of an appetite for food or life or emotions. Mine is much bigger.\n",
            "Doctor: We do need to stop for today. I will see you on Wednesday.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: Troy We Care\n",
            "Patient: YouTube\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: So you've been having a rough time?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, more panic attacks and stuff. It was really Cindy who wanted me to get the extra appointment. So I said sure because it was starting to get really rough on him because it wasn't like I wanted to hurt myself. It was me asking him like trying to convince him that it would be that he'd be better off if I were dead and stuff, which I guess I like something that's really hard to listen to.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that how you feel?\n",
            "Patient: that's how I feel when I'm in that much panic and I'm trying to rationalize it because I'm just like there is no way to make it better other than to not experience anything anymore and like right now I'm not panicking but\n",
            "Doctor: So what do you think now? And you're not panicking? What do you think about hurting yourself?\n",
            "Patient: I don't want to hurt myself right now because I'm not panicking. So I thinking normal. But yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So it must be pretty scary for him to listen to.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean he knows that I'm actually not going to hurt myself. Oh, what's the difference? Like when he gets really crazy like he's done things like hitting his head on the floor something. He drives himself from like trying to bash his head in on the wall, but still I'm not like\n",
            "Doctor: Are you sure that he knows that you're not going to do it? Are you sure you know that you're not going to do it?\n",
            "Patient: Sure. I know that I'm not going to do it. I'm pretty sure he I mean I guess there was a point like on Tuesday night where I like went to the bathroom and was there for like a little while and said he was like wondering what happened to me because he has all the shaving stuff is in his bathroom. And so he thought that I like my trying to hurt myself, which really, I was just taking a while in the bathroom and hadn't even occurred to me that the shaving stuff was in the bathroom. So like that was like the one time that he was really like worried.\n",
            "Doctor: He was concerned.\n",
            "Patient: But I didn't do anything.\n",
            "Doctor: So I guess I'm curious about him. What it does for you to talk about it because it sounds like you feel certain even when you're in those moments that although you want the pain to stop that. You're not actually going to hurt yourself. So I'm wondering what does it do to talk about it. Does that make it better? Does that make it worse?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think it makes it worse. I think it's sort of like I have this urge to talk about it. So like it's me being weak, I guess and guess it's like lately. I've been trying to be better about and stuff but\n",
            "Doctor: You've been week.\n",
            "Patient: Oh the fact that I gave in instead of just not saying anything at all. I mean not that Sydney wants me to like not telling what I'm feeling this way, but I guess I could do it in a more productive way.\n",
            "Doctor: What would that be?\n",
            "Patient: Not asking if I could kill myself, but just be like by the way, I feel like I want to hurt myself right now.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you want him to do? What do you want his response to be?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know because I feel like if he did give me permission to kill myself. That would probably make him a very bad boyfriend.\n",
            "Doctor: And it sounds like you don't actually want to.\n",
            "Patient: At least not now but when I feel like that like I mean, I guess I would if he were to give me permission to like her myself like in a way that wasn't permanently damaging. It could figure out that out like that would be something that would actually be productive because then I thought I don't even know that hurting myself in a non permanently destructive way. Would even like actually do anything to temporarily relieve the pain it just my brain thinks it will end but like he isn't even okay with that. So it's not like I'm going to change his mind on anything.\n",
            "Doctor: Would it be okay with you? Do you think it's okay to hurt yourself?\n",
            "Patient: maybe if it wasn't permanently damaging or even like damaging at all like just momentarily cause pain like I don't see the problem with it, you know, if it wasn't something that could become dangerous like I'm really liking the things that could do it but like\n",
            "Doctor: So there's the problem.\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Hurting yourself is hurtful.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, they're really like so many injuries that people get that. They like immediately recover from you know, I feel like they concerned with cutting yourself. Not that I could do that with the whole and cutting is that like the concern becomes that you're going to cut yourself too much too much blood comes out there going to get an infection that there will be scars on your body or that you'll like, you know, what the wrong way and I bleed out like\n",
            "Doctor: Those are all risks.\n",
            "Patient: But if you do it correctly that way you could avoid all these risks and not actually permanently damn the scars which you can't really avoid.\n",
            "Doctor: The other problem with you cutting or hurting yourself in any other way is that it doesn't stop the problem. There isn't somebody who cuts once and never feels to panic again or the depression or the status again without working through whatever it is. That's creating Panic. They're not effective treatment. You might maybe somebody feels distraction a relief in the moment, but it doesn't do anything to prevent the next panic attack or his change the external situation that might be creating a stress. It just adds another problem and one that's potentially difficult to manage the risk. I know you're having a lot of panic and it's really uncomfortable. But I don't know how adding another issue on top of that is going to make you feel better.\n",
            "Patient: Well, it's not like anything I'm currently doing is really effectively managing the panic.\n",
            "Doctor: That's true. You seem to be having a lot of trouble finding something in that will Elevate what's going on?\n",
            "Patient: Like I've been on the reduced while Butrans and it's not so this is like the 6th day of being on reduce Wellbutrin and like I can't really see much of an effect like it isn't making me worse. So I guess that's a good thing. So it's like I just wanted to reduce the Wellbutrin anyways, so\n",
            "Doctor: But it's not so it's not having a negative fat, but it's not having a positive effect either.\n",
            "Patient: Like it's sort of like I guess the Panic often it won't start until mid-afternoon perhaps earlier, but if so happens it still happens almost every day.\n",
            "Doctor: almost everyday\n",
            "Patient: If not every day.\n",
            "Doctor: how many panic attacks are you having in a day?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure because they're like at least a couple but then again maybe you could consider them like, you know, if I don't get a describe distraction that it's one panic attack just a very long panic attack, you know, and then I guess like when I have a rehearsal and stuff, okay, so I have a panic attack right before her so go to rehearsal feel fine for rehearsal get out of rehearsal another panic attack.\n",
            "Doctor: So whenever you're not occupied.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: your mind or your body or can I can\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like last night yesterday. I was like able to hold out for until 4 ish or so and then even then I was still able to like something like cuz normally panic attacks like prevent you from going out about your day today life and mine don't. Like I can still do things like I still was like, okay. Well, you know, I need a lock and someone bought one for me. So I'm going to walk to the post office drop off these packages.\n",
            "Doctor: And you could do it.\n",
            "Patient: and I could do it and\n",
            "Doctor: Were you can I can while you're doing that or the panics would have some side of it while you were active?\n",
            "Patient: I was panicking while I was doing it, you know and still panicking when I was at the theater and like adding photos about the aren't things to put up on my store and panicking, you know, when I was sending emails and stuff and I guess I didn't do that much. I did some productive things. I guess. I went grocery shopping, but that was before the Panic it started and oh we went to the store and I was still panicking then and we drove home like we had to go to his house to get some packages that he had gone. And so we went to the store on the way there then you know, and he was driving there to the store and then to his place but then on the way back he asked if I could drive because he's not really good with night driving and it was really really tired and I was like, okay. Well, you're really really tired and I'm just panicking and I drove home and managed to drive home without hitting anyone or doing anything on safe and park the car all-out Panic Game.\n",
            "Doctor: That's unusual.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: How did you manage to do that? How did you focus your thoughts enough to be able to make good decisions and drive safely?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I guess I was sort of focusing on the road. But like, you know, there was still that underlined uncomfortable feeling inside me. That was anxiety and like it was very much still there and I was aware in like, okay, I'm driving this car while I'm panicking so I don't know how I did it. I just did things because I had to I think that's usually the way things happened to me so that if I can get anything productive done, it's like because it has to be done.\n",
            "Doctor: It seems like that ability. You have to be able to somehow Focus your thoughts on what you need to focus on can be used because once you the more usually the more you get engaged with something Panic subsides enough so that you're not so that it doesn't feel like a panic attack right when you said like you're having a panic attack before rehearsal. You didn't during rehearsal. You were engaged and not focused enough in what you were doing that the anxiety was reduced enough so that it wasn't bothering you.\n",
            "Patient: Well, then I didn't feel it all I think the thing is like it can only it has to be something that takes up my entire like Consciousness and stuff driving. I can still think about other things walking to the post office I think about other things and so there I can just do these things while panicking whereas rehearsal like once I get into his like, you know takes up all my\n",
            "Doctor: And you get absorbed in it.\n",
            "Patient: yasso\n",
            "Doctor: It seems like you we need to find ways for you to be more absorbed more often during the day.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder if part of what's happening is that there's not enough of your day right now is taken up by things that feel productive but feeling gauging I don't think you're satisfied and that space that empty space you have is being filled by Panic.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but it's like I don't know like sometimes I have more control than others. But like, you know, like I don't control whether or not I have rehearsal that's like based on the semester and stuff and whether or not we have a concert coming up. So, you know, I had it Tech last week this week. I only have rehearsal on Tuesday night because\n",
            "Doctor: Are there other things you can do? Can you volunteer more? Can you schedule outings with friends so that you're not staying home?\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I don't know whether or not there would be enough to because they're not like something doing productively today like after this. I have an interview for the like I'm actually finally interviewing at the temp agencies.\n",
            "Doctor: I noticed you were wearing dressy or clothes than usual.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that was on purpose. So like maybe they'll be able to start me with something as soon as Monday if they could that would probably solve the problem at least while I'm at work and then I guess I'll have to deal with the panic in the evenings, but\n",
            "Doctor: If you even panicked.\n",
            "Patient: But of course that also assumes that work is something that doesn't take, you know to take a nap in my brain because I was just thinking like if I'm at work like especially now that I like finished actual project I needed to finish like if I'm just coming and he'll like do whatever like I don't know like hair is very talkative. So if I end up wasting time and talking to like Terrence F then like be occupied enough, so yeah, it depends on it really depends on what I do because lots of things still take up all my brain like last night when I was panicking said he was like, why don't you try knitting I was like, okay, I guess and I like try knitting and it did absolutely nothing which is what I figured it would because it wasn't really taking up enough my brain. So like I don't know if getting together cuz like hanging out with Sydney is not enough to make it go away most of the time even if we're like watching a TV show or something the Panic still there. I guess there has to be something where I'm like actually required like because of her son required to do things. You know, I have to sing can just stand there. So\n",
            "Doctor: Are there spots that trigger the panic? I know what that starts you say. You just kind of think I'm panicking and panicking, but I wonder if you noticed what happens just before you notice the panic.\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so. Like I really don't think there's anything that trigger is like it just happens and then I just filled the physical thing feeling and then I'm just like, oh no not again, like the feeling doesn't come there's nothing that comes before the physical feeling as far as I can tell like I've never been so I'm pretty sure it's just happening and not being triggered by anything.\n",
            "Doctor: And it feels really out of your control. I can hear that. Oh, no, not again and it feels like there's nothing that you can do to correct it or moderate it at all.\n",
            "Patient: It didn't last night like, you know, I started like whenever we got home at like, you know, maybe like before midnight like I took my nighttime meds which included the Klonopin like when I got home and then I was still up for like another hour or so panicking and the Klonopins and nothing immediately. So, you know, which leads me to believe that if I had, you know earlier I taken a quarter Klonopin the same thing would have happened where it wouldn't have done anything mediately. So\n",
            "Doctor: So you don't feel like the Klonopin helped at all.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know like I guess it doesn't and used to help but not like if it does it doesn't such a subtle way that like it doesn't help immediately help as I could see working right away.\n",
            "Doctor: Usually people feel in effect in about 20 minutes.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Yeah that didn't happen last night.\n",
            "Doctor: And usually a panic attack is over with in 20 minutes typically.\n",
            "Patient: yes, which also didn't happen last night or any night, so\n",
            "Doctor: It's been a really rough couple of weeks.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What's been going on in Sydney? Has he been doing the past few weeks?\n",
            "Patient: He's been doing better other than we've gone into a couple of fights last couple of days. Like when I've been all panicky and like taking it out on him and I feel bad about doing that and\n",
            "Doctor: So you kind of flip-flopped a bit and he's been doing a little bit better and he's been doing a little bit worse.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, sometimes he still has problems like doing things like getting out of the house, but in general like he's been doing a lot better than he had been.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think there's any connection?\n",
            "Patient: Because he's doing better and I'm doing worse. I don't think so.\n",
            "Doctor: You know, you're often the strong one for him. So I wonder if now that he's doing better. You know, you're often the strong one for him. So, I wonder if now that he's doing better. You don't have to be a strong he relies on you a lot when he's not feeling well.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it could be that but the Panic would have been there all along and I just been holding it back like, you know when you get if you're in school and you get sick right after finals because your body is like had been fighting it off for like a half semester and then all the sudden it's like where you've got to get sick. So\n",
            "Doctor: But your guard down a bit and it takes over.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so maybe I mean that's entirely possible, but I didn't make the connection err.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know if there's a connection but I guess you guys spend a lot of time together. You guys are very closely connected and I wonder if it almost works as a system rather than complete independence of one another.\n",
            "Patient: possibly\n",
            "Doctor: I wonder if you can find a way where you could both do really well.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's really hard on that. We're hoping that fixing the other issues, you know, but at temp I'm making like however much you know, they let you put a like however much you would want. And so I put my minimum it like 13 hours. So if I was working 40 a week like I would be enough to support myself.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, well, I think that would be a big would certainly relieved One external stressor.\n",
            "Patient: Because I wouldn't be dependent on my parents and I could buy all the things I could finally properly yell at them for not giving their employees health insurance because they would no longer be like, oh, well you're profiting from this and I'd be like not anymore and it would have to deal with them.\n",
            "Doctor: That would feel nice to be able to say some of the things you can hold them back.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, though. And just not feeling guilty every time I have to spend money on anything like isn't a necessity.\n",
            "Doctor: Carrying around that guilt probably does weigh on you.\n",
            "Patient: And then also the whole getting out of the house and having something to do.\n",
            "Doctor: So there's a lot that would change if this works out. Was there anything you could write a cover letter for this week?\n",
            "Patient: I mean there was the same last week. I haven't really tried this week because I've been well there was the whole getting back and forth temp agency and in the whole Panic thing, so\n",
            "Doctor: so that got in the way of even being able to\n",
            "Patient: Write a cover letter. Yeah, I mean I used to have like, you know, I get out of here and my thing is at 12:30 and it'll take like maybe 20 minutes to get down in the downtown crossing so I can theoretically like look and see if there was one thing to write a cover letter for but the deadline would have been for\n",
            "Doctor: This is true. But since I have you here today, I thought I'd ask.\n",
            "Patient: So I'm not actually been looking for things. Yeah, but I couldn't be right one cover letter. Maybe if there's something that there's probably something.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think that the job postings will probably slow down later this month when the world shuts down for Christmas or at least this part of the world. So using that while you can, you know, when people might still be putting in their postings up earlier in the month try to take advantage of that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Try to focus your mind on things that you can do rather than letting it be filled by whatever pops up which right now and it's empty. The thing that pops up is not feeling good.\n",
            "Patient: Question. Should I be like looking into cognitive behavioral therapy group thing?\n",
            "Doctor: We did lots of cognitive.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so would that like be?\n",
            "Doctor: So the behavioral piece of cognitive-behavioral is some of the actions that I encourage you to take things like scheduling and walks creating a structure in your day and some of the breathing exercises and relaxation exercises. We tried I know we did some last time. I'd like to try some again today. Those are some of the behaviors that often work to manage anxiety symptoms and the cognitive piece when people say cognitive behavioral therapy are things like when I ask you to try to come up with an alternative way to think about something to challenge some of the beliefs and assumptions that you make\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so basically all the stuff I end of fighting against okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, and so positive behavioral therapy is what most people recommend for anxiety because it works for lots of people to manage. Sometimes you struggle against it, but I keep sneaking it in there and I hope that at some point it will take hold for you and that you'll be able to get use out of it, but they're hard for you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you think it is that makes those Concepts really hard for you to sort of grass.\n",
            "Patient: because I feel that I'm smarter than them and\n",
            "Doctor: cake\n",
            "Patient: Write a note these. They're like ones that were trying to put in my head to be more useful, but they're not necessarily true. And therefore I'm trying to believe something that isn't true or isn't the whole truth and I can't make myself do that.\n",
            "Doctor: Would you rather be right or comfortable if you had to pick one?\n",
            "Patient: I would probably pick comfortable but like\n",
            "Doctor: But you don't.\n",
            "Patient: I don't have the ability to because I'm to focus on being right and I don't have the ability to I don't know if I want to be comfortable though at the expense of believing something. That isn't true. If I I don't have that sort willpower to believe something that isn't true. I'm too skeptical.\n",
            "Doctor: But you're not skeptical of your own beliefs.\n",
            "Patient: Well, sometimes I am but it depends on the situation.\n",
            "Doctor: Because for some people what's useful is not necessarily the leading another thing but believing that there are other possibilities. That's true skepticism that there isn't there isn't necessarily one. Right but that there are lots of ways to look at something or lots of possibilities and we're uncertain that there's some level of uncertainty in any of the beliefs and sometimes that you're not necessarily choosing a different belief, but you're just choosing to believe that there may be some wiggle room or an error in anyone believe. It's people freedom to just feel more comfortable and if you want to comfort sometimes that helps\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, maybe I'm too stubborn to choose comfort in like stubborn.\n",
            "Doctor: Like part of you wants to be comfortable right now, but right now it's more important to be right.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, just because I'm so stubborn, you know strongly believing that I'm right with things like therefore. I have trouble believing that there might be other options when I know that I'm right. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like I'm right it could also be like the depression lying to me but\n",
            "Doctor: What do you mean by that?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I don't know just like in general depression wise to the self. So I mean it's like I know there are times when I know I'm not right. I mean like when I'm feeling like oh, I would be better off if I were dead. So I mean there's the rational part of my back in the back of my mind. It's like no that's not true. That's just those depression lying to you.\n",
            "Doctor: Does anxiety lie in the same way?\n",
            "Patient: I guess sort of\n",
            "Doctor: How made it?\n",
            "Patient: I'll just say yes thinking making me think that this Panic is so bad that I wish I could die over it or telling me that if I hurt myself it will make me feel better which probably always wasn't true\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think I'm going to greet with you that. Yeah, I think I would agree with you there that those do feel like anxiety lies.\n",
            "Patient: yeah\n",
            "Doctor: So what is your truth? So if those are anxiety lies and depression lies will call them. What is the truth on the other side of that?\n",
            "Patient: that will theoretically this anxiety isn't actually worth killing myself over and that it will go away eventually it just doesn't feel like it will go away eventually because here I am you know doing my best to be productive and trying to do all the responsible things and not getting anywhere with it like it's just so frustrating\n",
            "Doctor: I'm so when you did ask about cognitive behavioral therapy The Next Step there. So one step would be is what you just did for me. This is the anxiety lie. And here's another way to think about it. Maybe the anxiety feels really horrible right now, but it wouldn't be better to die. That's an alternative relief and you just came up with it. The next piece is to look at what you said next was doing all these things and it's not working and I'm really frustrated making that so that's very kind of absolute. It's not working making that a little less absolute doing all the responsible things that I'm supposed to be doing and you're not working and just adding right now. It doesn't make it untrue, right? It's not working right now. That's very true. But what it does, do you said makes you feel a little bit like a little bit less like it will never ever ever ever work when you say it's not working. Could go on you could assume in there. It's not working. It's never going to work not working forever. And if you just add staying in the present, it's not working right now that actually takes a little bit of intensity off because it Makes it a little bit less overwhelming to think that you're going to be stuck in this particular situation. Robber is unbearable to think that you're going to be stuck in a horrible situation for a limited time is still totally uncool, but it's less than bearable. We can usually bear tribe tragedy or intense discomfort for a limited time. You actually you were doing some of the steps of the cognitive work that helps and just pushing yourself to take that next step making it present centered rather than letting your thoughts be about the future Beyond that's part of what makes it so overwhelming. It's when you think it's going to be forever.\n",
            "Patient: But it still feels like it's you know, because like I feel like I shouldn't be kept on something by now, like shouldn't a medication change which I guess it has if there's stuff like like, okay now, I'm not panicking every morning. I'm just you know, it pushes it off until the afternoon and maybe I should call again and ask her about levels what if I took half in the morning and half in the afternoon and split it up more?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, so it's not working perfectly, you know probably close to perfectly but it does seem but something has changed and so letting yourself see those little pieces rather than it being All or Nothing rather than it's not working at all. Well, it does seem to be delaying the Panic making yourself recognize different shades of grey.\n",
            "Patient: I guess it's like my whole understanding of the situation is you know, like how am I going to work then? Because like, you know when I take the medicine at night that I'm supposed to take at night that's supposed to help with the pain making out and then an hour later. I'm still panicking. Maybe it's not I would have been Panic even more and maybe I'm panicking last but I'm just panicking so much that I can't tell the difference.\n",
            "Doctor: sometimes\n",
            "Patient: you know, like if my Panic level was at 200 and now is at like 2:50, and so\n",
            "Doctor: Right. Maybe you don't notice a difference. Absolutely.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What we need to do is keep working until it's different enough.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That it's more recognizable.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but yeah, I guess the other question is also like did I ever do the whole like signing the waiver for you to talk to? Dr. Barnes about the medicines? Okay. I thought I did. I was just double.\n",
            "Doctor: I believe I sent your file.\n",
            "Patient: Checking. Okay, I assume I find it on her into\n",
            "Doctor: The one you signed here is a to a release. So she may want you to have one for her records, but you're technically covered.\n",
            "Patient: okay.\n",
            "Doctor: And you know, I'm happy that I talked more with her but you do I think you do an excellent job staying on communication with both of us. A lot of times people are unsure about what they're supposed to take or how much but you're very careful about that. It's good to have the release so we can communicate if needed but what you doing a good follow up with her, it's not a sound of Siri for me to hear her. Say the exact same thing.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, that makes sense. I guess I should call her this afternoon.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, give her an update of what's Happening. You followed the steps that she's outlined us far and let her know how it's affecting you but it seems to be pushing them off a little bit Delana maybe but that you're still really suffering.\n",
            "Patient: It's like I don't have an appointment with her until the 19th, which is like another almost two weeks.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, no.\n",
            "Patient: So are there for like that's still another two weeks of?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, what's the plan from now till then is it that your time will help more on a lower dose of Wellbutrin?\n",
            "Patient: Not really like it was just step 1 Step 2 and then wait till then.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, then that's why you're checking with her to see what\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was just a week, you know, okay, so I did the you know switching to a lower Wellbutrin like a day or two early, but now it's been almost two weeks since the appointment with the week of the Klonopin the week of the lower Wellbutrin, like lowering the Wellbutrin stops the taking more Klonopin. It's one at a time. So, yeah, I guess I could call her and ask about the intermediate stuff spreading out the Klonopin more and whether or not it would work because like I think it's like, you know low enough that it doesn't like cause me to be too tired during the day. I have been I mean I've gotten tired lately but not in the morning when I take two Klonopin. I think it's more just like all the Panic is making me tired.\n",
            "Doctor: Panic is exhausting your body goes through a lot to get to that intense feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Like last night. The other thing was when I took a Klonopin at like midnight whatever and I ended up going to bed at like 12:30 or something. And then I was able to fall asleep just fine. And then I woke up at 2:30 and was like completely and totally awake and panicking.\n",
            "Doctor: It's really disruptive when you think of panicking.\n",
            "Patient: And I was able to get back to sleep until again after that and that's how I slept through the rest of the night kept on waking up in the middle of the night is really frustrating.\n",
            "Doctor: How long does it take you to get back to sleep?\n",
            "Patient: I don't think it took me too long. You know, I got up till I go to the bathroom. A little bit because he had also woken up but I don't think he woke me up and then I had him go downstairs and get me a towel roll because also I had been feeling like a little bit of stomach acid trying to reduce all that and so he went downstairs and got me a whole the role that we split it and so ate my half and then I was able to go to sleep but there's no way to prevent myself from waking up in the middle of the night. Really.\n",
            "Doctor: You don't have a lot of control when you're sleeping and it's very disruptive to be broken without anxiety.\n",
            "Patient: maybe I guess I could ask if I could take some sort of like Sydney takes Ambien, but I there was one time I took one of his Ambience and that was like the night I was trying to sleep when I was like super duper sick and throwing up. And I ended up throwing up the Ambien but like\n",
            "Doctor: And you don't generally have trouble falling asleep.\n",
            "Patient: No, but I'm having trouble staying asleep. So I don't know if sometimes in general I don't but with the panic and also has made it harder to fall asleep to.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, let's see if we can't find other ways to kind of lower the general anxiety Baseline. Your Baseline of anxiety right now is really high. Your panic attacks are lasting longer than typical panic attacks. That's really high generalized anxiety. And I think if we can lower that your sleep will return to what your typical sleep is like.\n",
            "Patient: Will sleeping more help and general things.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a cycle absolutely being sleep deprived makes you more prone to anxiety. But you do have the ability if you wake up at night to sleep longer during the day to kind of catch up from that and rather than adding another medication to the mix. We're already making a lot of Med changes.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so that's when I like I could take as needed. It wouldn't be like taking every night.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you can certainly ask your psychiatrist about it and see what her thoughts are.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: She would know best how it fits into the overall plan. Let's take a few minutes to practice that deep breathing and muscle relaxation again and see if we can't get that working for you and then regular appointment on Monday. Okay, so close your eyes so you can tune in to what your body is feeling and let yourself just follow a natural rhythm with your breathing getting your body mentally and just taking notice of what your body feels like noticing any places that feel tight and tense anything that feels uncomfortable but yourself shift, however, you need to to relax those spaces. And then as you let yourself get more comfortable, but yourself extend your breath so that you're taking slightly longer Fuller inhales and exhales. I want you to try something called time to breathing. You're going to work your own time. What you're going to do is as you inhale do a razor inhale and just count to four as you do it. And then after you've taken a full inhale before you're going to hold your breath for four and then you going to Exhale for 4. So work at your own pace to get into that rhythm. inhaling for 4 and holding for 4 and exhaling for 4. Repeat that cycle a few times.\n",
            "Patient: Steel Valley\n",
            "Doctor: inhaling for 4 holding for 4 exhaling for 4 as you're comfortable doing that you can scan your body again noticing any places where it might feel different than it felt before no need to judge the feelings. No need to judge if it's the same or different just noticing it. And now just let yourself return to normal breath inhales and exhales at whatever Pace feels natural to you. And then let yourself return to the room like over your focus. That was different than what we've done before. What was that like for you?\n",
            "Patient: Holding my breath for four was a little bit Disney now. It shouldn't have fun.\n",
            "Doctor: Don't judge it. It is what it is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but like I seen I've had to do holding, you know, you see my air for a lot longer than that. It's from sitting down and stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, so it's probably not right. It's probably because you've done with singing you do breathwork whether you're focusing on breathwork or not, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It just happens to be saying so it's probably the Odyssey feeling is probably not about the air, but you felt it. So it means something.\n",
            "Patient: I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: So maybe it's just uncomfortable for you. So it's not dangerous, you know, you can breathe for a count of four. You've held a note longer than that. So it's not about whether you really have enough air, but something about focusing on it felt different to help dizzy. That doesn't have to be a bad feeling.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Yeah, I like to breathe in and out before I get that extra for for holding it because yeah, I guess I'm used to heading out over a long. Of time.\n",
            "Doctor: a long. Of time\n",
            "Patient: Like there's no.\n",
            "Doctor: something about stopping and holding it felt different.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And part of doing an exercise like that is that you want to feel something different. So when you're in the middle of a panic attack where you might be reading and lots and lots and lots of oxygen doing something different can be enough to shift it. So it's not necessarily that you're looking to feel something in particular when you're panicking. You just want to feel something different. So you might so now I've introduced you to two types of relaxation exercises the last time we did a little bit of deep breathing and then a very muscle focused one and they just show something different because I want to give you options and you know, try it out. You can try it when you're not panicking, but when you are panicking and know that you're safe. You know if you're sitting in a chair. Answer to be a little bit busy. It's a different feeling but that's not a dangerous feeling to you. And it sometimes people feel dizzy because they're paying so much attention to their breath in a way that they're not used to paying attention to it. And that's why I only had you do it for a few minutes. You don't want to do it for an hour because send it with the overwhelming. So like I think I had you count or five Cycles maybe and then let yourself return to normal and it might be just enough to move you out of where you are two different place. Okay. I will see you on Monday. Yeah regular time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: How are you?\n",
            "Patient: Didn't set my alarm and it didn't go off. So zorg woke me up at 12:35 saying don't you have an appointment with Chad today? So I may be still a little bit.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Got to give you long enough to wake up.\n",
            "Patient: Pink's yeah, I think I'm awake. I was mostly worried about that. I was going to stumble out into the street and once I got outside, I was like, okay Tanya you really have to pay attention.\n",
            "Doctor: I see ya.\n",
            "Patient: So I went out for drinks after church last night was sort of not the normal crowd of parishioners that I usually go to but the crowd of the pig musicians in one of the priests and some other people. I feel like I've been doing some more socializing recently and good but man, it just makes me just not during it actually but afterwards I can't stop picking things apart that I said and things that I said wrong and reasons for them to hate me and call that so if you'll start of paradoxical that I have had a nice evening out with some friends it is something that makes me feel sort of bruised and anxious and I don't know maybe particularly vulnerable but I don't know that's the way I am. So it is It's funny. I sort of was worried about my drinking and about that. I was drinking a lot more James and I just haven't really bought any beer in the last month like just haven't done it and I just don't really notice. So that makes me happy.\n",
            "Doctor: That's good.\n",
            "Patient: I mean not quite as happy as I could because I would like to be drinking beer, but what I noticed I think that but most of the time I don't really notice I had some nice beer last night though. I'm doing good.\n",
            "Doctor: That's probably good.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it was good. I felt like this morning at least I keep getting upset with James and I don't know whether it's that he's doing things differently that I'm more sensitive to the things that he says than usual or that I'm different. Yeah, like we're driving into therapy and the traffic is frustrating. So he sort of his snippy with me and it is like the most predictable occurrence in the world. It's not really okay, but I also told him that it's not really okay and it keeps happening and I don't want something I'm sort of willing to put up with I don't like this but it's not like that big of a deal and I know that I know what's going on and we sort of talked about that and went like, okay, that's fine. And you know, it just gets under my skin. Actually that pretty much just gets under my skin every time I try for it not to and I tried different ways of handling it but it just keeps getting under my skin. But on the way back I mentioned I haven't forgot 10 wanting to get a tent and\n",
            "Doctor: attend\n",
            "Patient: yeah a tent and his immediate and the only response was yeah, we really can't afford that right now and I was like, I really know we know we can't afford it. I really know I just feel like I'm trying to tell you that I'm lonely and I want compact companionship and I feel like I'm being rebuked for wanting these things at all. And that's not really responsible a reasonable response on my part. It's sort of a jump. I feel like to ask him to see this code and what I said on the other hand, I don't think it's a jump for me to want his knee-jerk response to me say that I want something to be like we can't afford that.\n",
            "Doctor: Especially when he knows that could or should know that he'd know that.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: also notice that you didn't start of describe. What happened. What were you saying? What was going on that really before? I guess on the way to the therapy session and that's fine. But I I guess what I wondered is whether you were concerned that. I imagine two things, but I didn't feel. It would just make you feel worse to explain it like it would make you feel worse about how much it bothered you.\n",
            "Patient: I think that's probably at that it's sort of easier to refer in Broad Strokes to this Dynamic and I feel like I've talked about before and it's also so naked. I feel like I'm under the impression that I've talked about it to you before but maybe not.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know. I guess not knowing what happened has.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I'm like\n",
            "Doctor: I don't ya.\n",
            "Patient: James is frustrated in part and part James is frustrated with driving and we try to make a left turn off comment on to the church and we could only see the right hand side. I said this is your turn and he said is it I don't think is that what the sign says? I don't think it's my turn and I was like no, I guess that's not what the sign says, but it was actually the turn before a different Road on both sides of the street. So we missed it and you had to make a U-turn and he was so frustrated and I could sort of feel him wanting to make it my fault, but it was clearly. I was the one who said this is your turn because I remembered it. So there was that and then he didn't actually try to make it my fault, but you could sort of\n",
            "Doctor: You could feel it.\n",
            "Patient: I could feel it.\n",
            "Doctor: And then we park you're looking for parking. And we end up in one of the spots. That had to have quarters instead of taking your credit card and we didn't have quarters. And then we had to move on move and and he was just grumpy with me about it. I don't remember what he said. I just remember him being grumpy with me. You know, I just he and I have sort of talked about this several times and he started made it clear when we talked about it that he's not upset with me. He's just pissed about the driving and the spills over and I sort of find it unacceptable that it spills over but I recognize that that's just something that people's emotions do sometimes and I don't know how much is reasonable to ask him to not indicate that he's frustrated anyway. Great.\n",
            "Patient: Because I also have a problem where if he expresses frustration, I take it as being about me. Even if he's not actually making it about me.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but I feel like I actually think it that bad but I think my expectation was that if I described it that it will be sort of freshly painful and will be like reliving it and be freshly painful. Whereas if I just sort of allude to it or talk about the dynamic then that is something I have more control over.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I was feeling like a big bruise today and I don't really know why. Yeah, I'm not sure why.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Pretty tough. Actually, you know I'm in.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean not in any external way. I mean, I don't have crowded though anything obviously bad happened or any one said anything mean.\n",
            "Patient: Oh.\n",
            "Doctor: Nothing like that.\n",
            "Patient: Sounds really fun. It's sort of like after I came home and it started getting tough.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. bears there's I know this sort of I'm not quite sure. What do you do with this? You mentioned kind of feeling bruised after last night. You mentioned James getting under your skin this morning and you mentioned feeling like one big bruise. We talked about cutting last week and that was on your mind a lot. I think what I know.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I also did self-injury today.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: It's like a superpower.\n",
            "Doctor: Guess unwittingly. I read it reiterated a little bit of my x-ray vision.\n",
            "Patient: I love it. No, that's okay. There's something else too.\n",
            "Doctor: Sue and maybe this is making something out of nothing but Complicated my thought was a strict. I was shocked when you said it's like a superpower because maybe I'm saying something interpretive but you know. What it's like to be interpretive you've interpreted a lot of things I mean more.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You know.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I'm a little more comfortable being the one doing the interpreting.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I just want to feel like I think it's one of the reasons I take all of this sort of therapy. It's kind of like stuff. I'm quite familiar. It makes sense to me.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But it's comfortable.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, it's okay. I guess here's me.\n",
            "Patient: I also don't.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry, it's just it also doesn't it continues to surprise me that I am interpretable that in that way.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: It shouldn't but it does.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, this is sort of it's like there's some kind of NBA going on where it's sort of I think the idea that what you're trying what you're saying or presenting is interpretable or that there's something that's already on the surface. There's just something about people getting under your skin or getting a little bit into you that seems to be getting reiterated and made and where maybe this is it actually seems to be I guess I imagined that maybe there is something a little bit defensive about framing it that way what I have in mind is\n",
            "Patient: About framing it as getting under my skin.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, like like maybe it's kind of more out there already than you sing. Then you like to think that it is, you know, maybe like maybe James just pissing you off, right? You know what I mean? I I know what you mean understand that. And that one is big and I never would have gone anywhere with it. But like it sort of makes it less like you should necessarily be in control of it, or you should expect yourself to be in control of it if we think about. It is like James getting under your skin or it's if I have a super super x-ray vision and then it's not like it's kind of out there already and what you're saying. Or that you know it in a way unconsciously maybe even wanting me to know or trying to communicate it.\n",
            "Patient: Ya know it's always the trouble of the part of me that really wants people to know and part of me that really doesn't.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: so\n",
            "Doctor: I am just about out.\n",
            "Patient: no, it's okay. I don't know if you'll send me like I never stop thinking that I should be able to control it. But like there's not a way that I could phrase it that works. That would make me feel like it was incumbent on me to keep it. So to say like yeah, sometimes things are just out there is to say like I've really failed in some way.\n",
            "Doctor: I see and I imagine that s'more in your own eyes and on your own behalf and say it's not mine.\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: I imagine that since the failure is in your own eyes and on your own behalf rather than like as you feel it in mind in other words. I don't think you're imagining. I think you feel so much and as you're feeling like according to you, this is not how you're supposed to be.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: That's one of those things that yeah, I know. That's that that's not the way that you feel and it's not the way that everybody feels and maybe I do still feel that pretty much everybody that I need thinks. I should keep myself under control.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. It's sort of hard hard to tell. I was waiting for a train yesterday and somebody was yelling cunt and it sort of surprised me like like how afraid that makes me feel. It's like seriously come on, but still sort of freak out.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I think the way you're describing is actually feeling more connected to and reacted to people. That you would like to be or that then you like to be.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Sort of a way of thinking about the it had not occurred to me. I mean because like I want to be connected to people but it's hard for me to exceptionally being connected to people means that the things they do want matter to me and I won't just be able to absorb that.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it's also it also sort of an explanation. Anyway for what you're saying before about how you also want people to know.\n",
            "Patient: You know, I can't far to figure out why I would think that people knowing that I cut myself is why I would think that think of that is shameful thing or really like that. It bothers me when James is snippy with me, but that is something that I'm ashamed of. I don't know, you know afraid and also ashamed\n",
            "Doctor: I think that it seems less obvious than you would the same like it's easier to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. It feels sort of like so I write this blog, you know, like once every two or three months. I'll write something and it's a public blog and I will post a link to on Facebook and it never fails to sort of surprise and terrify me when people read it. Like what is wrong with me? I don't know. I wonder why I'm I'm not sure about this, but I wonder whether I'm ashamed of not being able to keep things under control or ashamed that I want to tell people about these things. I don't think I want people to know.\n",
            "Doctor: Are both kinds of Shame related to how much people matter?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean I guess like you know you know start of an intermediate sort of way like it just shouldn't make that much goddamn difference if James is being snippy if you know that he does this and you know what the context is and you brought it up with him before like you just shouldn't matter so goddamn much in the morning in the moment and what he's saying so literally shouldn't want people to know much know so much people shouldn't be that important that you care that much to tell them something I don't want you to sit back. Of course if the right people matter a lot, but I guess I'm wondering if there's somewhere if there's somewhere another way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think it feels like I just shouldn't we live these things from people relieve these things from people? Like I shouldn't need James to be nice to me as much as I do. So yeah, I get that. I can.\n",
            "Doctor: I can because I think you always feel a lot of Shame when you feel like you need people are not always but those two seem to go together.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I've been sort of. Getting upset and I don't know what I'm about like being here talking to you. And so I don't really know what to say about that, but it happens.\n",
            "Doctor: I see through the last few minutes.\n",
            "Patient: Sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: Do the last few minutes?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's scary for me to think about how much I need to be here how much it helps. I know. Yeah, I just feel sort of unbearable to say it.\n",
            "Doctor: haha makes you feel both really ashamed and also really afraid that. Not even my knowing that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: we you know, it seems like that's really kind of. The main thing or one of the main things that you were shame and worried about me and how that would like drive me away. And the way you deal with that is to be like you shouldn't or you should know more about the doctor thing Mark no more of the doctor thing. Sometimes you feel like you don't like it's on you if you're not more in control of how your affected by someone you need to you need or you're not more in control that you tell them.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like one of the things that is very scary for me about this relationship as well. Like the things that I do to start of State control of the situation. Don't really work very well.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Which I know is the point.\n",
            "Doctor: That's really terrible. Absolutely. I understand.\n",
            "Patient: It also feels like there's a relationship. There's probably a relationship between the things that I do to stay in control the situation not working and how much I need to be here and that's a little scary.\n",
            "Doctor: and I guess somebody that running kind of unclear like historically it's not hard to imagine where I came from but in terms of your actual unclear why it's so bad to need Arturo or rely on someone how you imagine that causes them or us to leave. I mean history. historically in a general way it's not hard to imagine where it came from, but there must be some sort some way in your mind that that works in that part at least me is clear.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it sort of feels like a connection. That's so obvious that why would he pick at it to me? I guess not.\n",
            "Doctor: Why we should stop.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hey, what's going on?\n",
            "Patient: I guess last time you suggested that I should not monitor. Tanya's mood on a day-to-day basis, which I think is good advice. I'm just sitting there thinking that it's maybe been a little bit harder than I anticipated. So I've been doing that Latonya also appears much better than I think she is in some ways. I think she's very anxious and very fragile. We talked about her not wanting control. I think she wants control more now than she has four months, but maybe can't handle it fully either. With her wanting control of her life again. She wants to take care of me because I important to her. As I mentioned some time ago. I don't know that I really trust her right now. There's a limit to what I can accept from her. It just is I guess. So we're in this place where she wants to take care of me and maybe I'm a bit standoffish and she just wants to talk about what's bothering her. That's fine normally but it seems like I don't know there's some strange sense in which the better she gets the less I can deal with their problems. It's kind of like when she's in an acute crisis. I can just deal with that. That's not a problem. But when she's appearing better, some of it just makes me angry or brings out that I am angry or something. She's anxious that she's not going to get a job. She started talking about how she sort of been sold the stream that you can go and get a Humanities degree and you'll get a job afterwards. That was a dream. She had always been sold. She had a whole lot of people getting her bad advice. It's just factually inaccurate. It just is not the least because in her first three years, she got a one degree and then she spent another year getting another degree instead of graduating early because she recognized that she couldn't get a job with the first degree. This is the conversation. We've been having for our entire relationship, but there is some sense in which her degrees do not lead to jobs. That's not why she was doing them, but now she can't get a job and that's a problem. I could recognize while it was happening that she was really just upset and looking for an outlet for being upset, but I couldn't stop also not being angry about her misrepresenting our conversations and the conversations. She has had with a lot of good people who had advised her in one way or another that there are three things to consider. Also when one is getting an education I think I feel guilty that I just can't handle all of it. But there's also a sense in which I acknowledge that I have limits and I seem to be running into some of them and ask it suspects for question of what are real limits and what are not real limits. So what should I just work harder at and what is actually a limit?\n",
            "Doctor: It sounds like you're feeling more Angry. Maybe we should talk more about that.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know exactly why. I've been feeling more angry at it. I think there's a sense in which Tanya wants to have her life back and have it be okay and wants to yeah, I'm not exactly sure don't actually she asked if we were okay and so we had a conversation which after thinking a while about whether I said anything or not acknowledge that I was angry that her illness or her actions were some Spectrum in there has really hurt me over the last several months and that I just need some time to recover from that. I don't know if I should have had that conversation or not. I wasn't sure while I was having it. It seems like the only path forward when asked directly. Yeah, I think it's something like as he knows since you've been seeing me the whole time and you remember all of it. I've been hurt a lot over the last several months. It's hard your art some real ways in which she has abandoned me. She's threatening to kill herself several times. Not in the like I'm going to kill myself. If you don't do this sort of way, but in a defective sense coming close to a suicide attempt is a threat to kill herself. I think we were outside of the crisis. I have injured emotions. I think that's the primary source of what's been going on, but I don't. It's sort of like the more she goes back to being normal that part isn't knowledge. So there's no sense in which I want to wallow in it or do well on it or hold her accountable for it. But saying that makes it sound like I just want the pain acknowledged.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel she could do that for you?\n",
            "Patient: That's a good question. I didn't really feel like she could know but then we had the conversation where she asked me directly if we were okay, so I sort of put it out there anyway, because there is a sense in which itself is an act of trust for me trust is in part built by trusting a little more than might be reasonable and seeing what happens. You can build a considerable amount of trust in that way but in smaller risks. I think it's too soon to tell whether she actually can or not, but she could in that moment. Acknowledge that of course, I would be hurt by those things. I don't think she thought about it very much. She said she hadn't really thought about her coming close to killing herself hurting me. She was most mostly just happy with herself for not having killed herself. All right, that's pretty okay, but it is also missing the effects on me and on everyone else in both of our families.\n",
            "Doctor: I realize I was thinking about this last week or maybe a few weeks ago that you haven't mentioned very much about her family your family just the impact and maybe it has just not been a focus of yours, but I was struck by that because I imagine it had to impact certainly her family but your family too.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, even if they didn't care about her at all, it impacts me so they would care about it, but they do care about her. They all love her a lot and have for years. Now. It's hard. We talked some months ago. I was talking with them a lot. But what am I supposed to tell them and not tell them at some point? I just don't need to tell in some sense. I need not to tell them that she wants tried to kill herself.\n",
            "Doctor: You didn't tell me that either.\n",
            "Patient: well It takes me awhile to trust people. I don't know. Maybe that hurts me less now. So I'm more okay saying it. I don't know that was back in November. That incident happened, I think.\n",
            "Doctor: That's quite an incident.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, she didn't actually attempt, but I think I don't know how you draw that line. There's a plan there's preparation. Our families gets into this question of how do I let other people take care of me? And how do I take care of them also and not ask them to carry too much. And then how do I balance all that with Tanya's name or seems needs at the same time? It's been a very hard optimization problem. The end result is that her father finally visited 2 weeks ago, but she hadn't wanted to see him before then and basically just wouldn't let him come. He wouldn't talk to him either. So it is like the burden on me. The burden is on me to communicate how she's doing. And then also tell these people who love her and her family's impulse is always just to show up and be there which in some ways is a really good impulse and in some ways, maybe not a great impulse. I think mostly it's really good. A little planning. Sometimes a good thing. It's how these people who really love her and want to be there for her. That's not what she wants right now. Even will not being sure that what she wants should count right now. So clearly taking some of her desires off the table is reasonable. I have two brothers and sisters and particularly. My sisters really want to be there for me and take care of me. But again, it's like at what point as far as the time issues we're getting into half a dozen or a dozen people. I can't talk to all of them everyday. I can't talk to you. I suppose if I talk to each one of them once a week we could talk for a little bit of time. There's no continuity of the area across people. It's just really bad. The whole thing is just really bad. There's often not an extent to which just talking about it helps sometimes for me knowledge is a really useful particularly when you get to the 3rd or 4th thing that's worn off. Now I'm just passing on Grief to someone else. Yeah, the whole thing has been pretty complicated in terms of our families. On another level it becomes another logistical challenge, which is I guess who I'm talking about it even though it's also a lot of other things. You're so many other logistical challenges that I've been handling over the last number of months. I just don't have the energy for some of them also.\n",
            "Doctor: You had said that you didn't tell them about her going to the bathroom. I said that you didn't tell me that either you said trust was you said trust. What was it? You said about the trust I said, sorry, let me repeat that. You had said that you didn't tell them about her going to the bathroom. I said that you didn't tell me that either you said trust. What was it? You said about the trust I was struck by that.\n",
            "Patient: I think it's something like the more important something is to me. Harder, it is for me to talk about so I have to trust in someone more in order to be able to talk about it. The only thing I think that plays into that one is that I didn't start seeing you until the end of January or February somewhere in there as just us. So before then there was an extent to which I didn't talk about something because we were still doing in theory something like couples counseling.\n",
            "Doctor: We were meeting just us, but it was still not the because I've only met with you and Tanya three times. So it was just I guess the context wasn't as clear but it was just us.\n",
            "Patient: No, sorry. It was just you and I but the patient was a relationship at the time in an official capacity and not me. That changed some of the things that I talked about like I didn't tell you about Tanya having this emotional affair until you were treating just me.\n",
            "Doctor: So I'm feeling like with the more trust. You can share more. Is it for Lee how I will talk to you about about it or feeling more trusting how we'll handle it together.\n",
            "Patient: That would be a reasonable feeling. I'm not sure I have any reason that's anywhere is reasonable is that I don't know as I have an articulated reason for it, which is interesting. I think it relates to some knowledge of or trust in response what response I will get immediately and where it will go from there. I think.\n",
            "Doctor: And how might it go wrong?\n",
            "Patient: On the one hand and this is not as much an issue in our relationship, but the other person may not be able to handle it. That one is alleviated by some sort of special trust in this case. mitigated not really somewhat mitigated Let's take a different one. See I was to talk to my mother about tonya's relationship with his Professor. I don't know how my mother would respond but it could go that my mother is angry or hurt and then I have to deal with those also and that hasn't helped me at all.\n",
            "Doctor: So you said mitigated not alleviated?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah that has to do with there's some amount of trust I put in you because this is your job. But I think I've mentioned before that. I don't trust that many people to do their jobs very well.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, and you've been underwhelmed by how some people are doing their jobs.\n",
            "Patient: Absolutely, so that's why I said change that because it's not like just you having this job makes me trust you. In a sense, that's a way of starting to put trust in you. I feel like you've been very helpful to me and you've done your job very well. And so I can trust you much more in some sense.\n",
            "Doctor: That's good to hear. I can sympathize a little bit but the part about Tanya and this emotional affair being less likely to discuss that with your parents or whoever seems like a different category than Tanya's illness and the extent to which she was suicidal, but somehow you see that a similar. Maybe I'm not sure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's not like I haven't told anyone that she's suicidal. But how many details do they need? I feel like the details drive it home or make it hurt more. They make it more real. Suicidal is kind of a fairly big word.\n",
            "Doctor: As is abuse a lot of things the devil is in the details.\n",
            "Patient: Right in both cases. We've talked before about me having some sort of Need for control and need to protect other people and take care of other people. I feel like the same thing is going both second stanzas in a sense. I am protecting my mother and I am protecting Tanya in the case of Tanya wanting to kill herself. I'm not protecting Tanya as much because I don't think there's that much more conveyed about her state in some way but the impact on my mother or whoever would be greater with more details.\n",
            "Doctor: It's interested because I was thinking that when you share something that you really need help with your actually assuming that the person would be able to deal with it better than you right. I'm not saying you feel about way but that's sort of the reason about talking about this with someone. It's too much for you. You're helping though actually help you deal with it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel like you're either hoping that they can handle the same circumstance better or that the circumstances less like you somehow the only person I talk to you about Tanya's relationship is my best friend and that's because Tanya almost told him or told him most of it but not enough so he called me and said what's going on but then I was in this position position of do I sit there and blunder about what's going on or I could tell him and that seemed clearly less bad, but there's a sense in which it's not so much that he could handle it better, but it wasn't as painful for him if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's right. I think what I'm doing is just quibbling a little bit about your suggestion or in suggesting a way in which they might be able to handle it better. But of course the place you're taking it back to you is that I currently have been able to handle things better than other people.\n",
            "Doctor: You're not sure of certain details like Tanya taking the plastic bag into the bathroom. You're thinking that you can handle it somewhat that somehow no one else could it would be too much?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, there's also a sense in which how many people need to handle that simultaneously.\n",
            "Doctor: Someone who is helping you would need to I'm not even talking simply about me. But anyone you would rely on to help you through this.\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry, you're going to have to expand on that a little bit.\n",
            "Doctor: I was thinking about this before with your siblings. You are kind of bringing a logical formula. There are this many people and I can only have this many conversations usually people are closer to one sibling or two siblings than others. That's who you talk to you about things that you need help with or that you share. There is a way in which you go into this very logical or there's a way you go into this. Dirty logical formula about time management. It's almost like kind of information management or an information flow management. Like that's how you think about it rather than I'm so overwhelmed. You can't believe this just happened. This is just catastrophic. I don't know what to do.\n",
            "Patient: You don't think those two are the same thing. My response is exactly the second one, but I know how to manage information and I know how to do these logistical things. So I go to those things because they're so lovable or closer to solvable. What do I do that? My wife want to kill herself? You can on the Practical problems and they are the practical problems of who needs to know. What and what do I need to do to make it from one day to the next?\n",
            "Doctor: Write will a piece of its managing yourself and sort of figuring out how you could organize yourself to deal with it another piece of it. What was the word that went through my mind? I can't think of the word something about taking care of it or how are you going to sort of sort of you being in charge of this feeling defacto and charge I have to say families are different and so forth, but I think God especially at your ages and I know it's complicated given who you are and given Tanya's family dysfunction given her father's abusive marriage and so forth, but it would be much more likely to be the parents and not the spouse. Especially for people in their twenties would be managing this like all of it.\n",
            "Patient: Eventually, I just asked my mother to manage information flow to my siblings and I just talked to her I guess on some level I agree.\n",
            "Doctor: I was sort of speaking to a norm. There's not going to be a right about the norm. I guess it makes me think about I don't know if you are Tanya said this you were born 40 something about the way you guys manage. It makes me think about keeping more in their 30s or especially 40s where your parents are older and you basically don't want to always bother them.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I always end up in charge of things.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, that's probably more than speaking about Norms or whatever which may actually be irrelevant on some level. I think that's maybe the point.\n",
            "Patient: No, I think the Mormons are good as some sort of Benchmark. I don't know why I always end up in charge of things. Some things I end up in charge of because I want to be speaking much more generally then like the specific illness. Music graduate student advisory Council in Ohio in the department of biomechanics that I ended up being co-chair of I didn't want them committee. I was elected while actively campaigning against myself. I did not want to be on the committee in the first place. I did not want to be the chair or co-chair this committee and I ended up doing it. Anyways his sense actually because no one else would and I could be convinced to do it and I don't know why I always end up in charge of things.\n",
            "Doctor: The footnote it's not really a footnote and no one else what often seems to be attached to that like the volleyball team.\n",
            "Patient: Right. So then you have to sort of wonder if I weren't there what would happen something would happen. I presume these organizations would not all part entirely. If I hadn't been there, what would have happened? I think Tanya's family would have come up and handled that or she would have killed herself, but then we're getting into. If I work here this whole situation would be radically different. Anyway, we're so far off of counterfactuals. We could actually observe that I'm not even sure what difference it makes. Yeah. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What were you just thinking about?\n",
            "Patient: just sort of nothing much. Particularly. Just how did we get to hear? What would her family do? Otherwise, how do I end up in situations like these? What do I do? I sort of do what seems best as best as I can figure it out then I'm in charge of it again.\n",
            "Doctor: Because what seems best is never for you that someone else handle it. Because it seemed best then you wouldn't always be in charge.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Then again, I'm not telling his therapist. So I feel like at least occasionally. I've come up with a different answer to that question. You know, I think it all would have been so much different if we would have been in San Antonio San Antonio or in Austin somewhere close to our families. The distance just add some extra logistical Dimension to it or something. It makes it I don't know. I guess it makes it so everything has to be planned. Somehow. I'm not sure.\n",
            "Doctor: Which is itself interesting. I think the fact that you guys are married makes it a little bit less convincing statement, but when people in their twenties gets get sick. They often go home and get treatment where their parents are. It's a logistical Dimension that also has a meeting and itself. That's not at all uncommon you're working on that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I agree that particularly in college when people get sick. They go home fairly often.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a little bit more nebulous in your 20s, but it's still pretty common certainly with a lot of different people under stressful circumstances.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, my friend Frank or friend prank on my best friend is here in Andover. He went with me a lot. I let him take care of me a fair amount. It's easier because he's here. I don't know the hurdle of traveling with large. But then why are we here? We're here because\n",
            "Doctor: I was thinking that it's not like you guys have to stay here because you both have jobs here and you can't leave.\n",
            "Patient: It's true for a while. We were here because Tanya was going to school and then we were here because Tanya had Chad here and it has been hard for her to find a therapist with whom you can actually work. Well or at least it seemed hard to her. I think really she's actually liked everyone she's seen not in the hospital in Andover very well. So I think maybe there are some left over by a Seas from poor treatment when she was young.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess we're going to need to stop in a moment. There's certainly more for us to talk about I guess in a sense what we're talking about. What I'm communicating is I'm challenging some of the assumptions about how is just logistically made sense that was in. The logistics there is a lot of meaning behind that in terms of the amount of responsibility have for Tanya. I guess that's what I was thinking about and the way you started today about feeling more of the anger especially as the X in exigency of the circumstance is subsiding. I don't want to get lost either. I have definitely noted that and I think that is important for us to continue talking about 2.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I will see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Processing test split:\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: Good morning. I'm really glad that you could see me today.\n",
            "Doctor: Good. Well, I mean. You know what? I mean?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's the about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm glad it worked out, but it's I guess I'm sorry you wanted to see me.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's about right. Yeah, I'm having sort of a tough time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I couldn't find my pants this morning. This is it just feels like a classic morning for me and some ways. I don't like talking last night and I was like, okay, I'm going to wear these jeans tomorrow and I put them somewhere and then this morning they were gone like totally gone. And I just remember I put them in a drawer with my shirt which I found after like 15 minutes of like where are my pants? I don't know. I've been looking around my apartment for things a lot more often than I typically to it's like most stuff. You don't end up staying for 1 year. To the next but maybe that's just me, but I broke my glasses a few days ago, and I had a backup somewhere. That was Despair and I like couldn't find them and I knew that I had an that I hadn't thrown them away because I was keeping them for this precise eventuality and James knew he hadn't thrown them away because he didn't know where they were and I didn't know where they were. And so I ended up looking everywhere in the apartment. My apartment is like about twice the size of this office like it's not very big. And there are not many places but like under the bed and I think I ended up like finding a lot of stuff that I couldn't remember and also a lot of stuff that remembered but didn't want to think about like I found my Sasha flash card like thousands of flash cards on tiny little pieces of cardboard tied together with rubber bands and a bag and like I found that bag and then like I found this beautiful very nice hiking pack that I didn't remember or like I recognized it but I didn't know where I was from and I didn't know I had it and James was like, yeah. That was your birthday present last year. So it's been like, I don't know. James really doesn't want to go to this wedding and you know, he's been pretty like I don't know. I think he's doing as well as he can in terms of both being cheerful and cooperative and like not saying that he wants to go to the wedding because he doesn't want to go I sort of I sort of want to go but I'm really tired from this week and then going to be more tired by the end of the weekend. It's not like I'm melting down over little things but I think it's mostly because I like I can't get to the point where I'm actually melting down over little things like it's like I think it's actually worse. I'm kind of like Frozen and sad and really upset and don't know what to do about it. Somehow I have to refill my prescription on Monday or by Monday. And I know that I'm going to not going to remember to do it like I know this but like I couldn't have done it today we got but I couldn't have really doesn't today. There's as much time in the West Des Moines. I've ended up missing like two or three days on my thyroid medication because I had run out on a Tuesday and then I can't get out until Friday and then I don't really want to move on Friday morning and I just made my life. There's also like four or five events in two days for the sweating right? It's 3 days, but like it's just all parties like all the time. It's like sort of going to be great and I sort of I just skipped some but I also can't skip them because there is are my cousins whom I love and I don't see I see the multi here. And I don't know James last night was like do you think we can be angry all the time? And I was like totally and because like Oliver had just gotten worse than he was in a really bad place like he was ship faced wrong. And you really like James and he really kind kind of wanted to mess with him a lot at the end of the evening. She was like I'm going to pick you up Oliver Oliver is like 5657. He's like a big guy for a little guy like over 6 foot and James's over and was like sure why not. I will make you happy. So we're going to be like tonight. I don't know whether Oliver's happy but his coffee shop is so that's nice and he has started the coffee company, which is a cafe in Maryland that somehow all of my friends who really really like so that's kind of nice. It's like the most hipster coffee shop in Maryland. I've gone to the point in my job where it's not so hard every week and it was hard this week. But in general it's like less than clearly exhausting. So I've started panicking that I'm not doing a good job anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: Sharon has started trying to say my name which considering like she has three words. I feel really good about you know, she doesn't say anything really remotely approximating. My name but clearly she's trying to apparently. Is really hard for small children. Like it's one of the hardest consonants. Yeah, it's more like and then she gets the egg in the end in there and she doesn't like she doesn't Babble that much or like she makes a lot of noise, but she doesn't have a whole lot of different consonants more like...... And then like noise. She's getting bossy or so. We'll see how this that goes. I think she really likes climbing up the stairs and when I don't want to climb up the stairs with her, which is most of the time she gets really mad. We're just too bad. She's really funny when she's mad like I'm trying to take you seriously, but you're not even a year old and you're argh. I feel like I should work harder on coming up with things to do. Like places to go like I don't know. I feel like I'm running out of things to talk about because I am well I talked about all of the things that are like sort of pretty much bothering me at the bothering me and not the things that are really really bad because I don't want to talk about things that are really really bad. And I also imagine that you don't want to hear about things that are really really bad and aren't actually that I don't know. And they're not incurred in anything. I just feel like shit and I just hate myself more than most of the time. I have to go to weddings. I have to like fine all my dresses and then that makes me and that makes me that doesn't help. So I have to bring dress sense for Amanda. Also, she got into a situation where all of her dresses are at her boyfriend's house and she really needs to break up with her boyfriend and she didn't have it in her. So do it so like the night before she was leaving she did was alright get off. It'll be okay. So I'm bringing like a dresses because there was like five things to do. And I don't feel very good about any of them. And I don't know why it matters so much. I did suggest to Amanda that she not caught off all her hair.\n",
            "Doctor: Amanda\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and probably for emotional reasons, but I don't think it would look as good on I don't think it would look as good on you. So we'll see. I don't know why we're still in the dynamic of where Amanda thinks that I'm like sensible responsible one or like the one who has all of her shit together. I don't know why she thinks that but somehow Moxa Dynamic that were in I don't know what to do about your life Amanda. I don't know what to do about my life. The only thing I really know is that I think that you should be in therapy and you don't really react to that so I mean considering all these experiences with therapist. I don't blame her, but I know how I don't know how else to say it.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know where she is?\n",
            "Patient: She's in San Antonio. I don't know whether she'll stay there. I think most of the time when Amanda has gone to therapy. It's been to get something made her because they thought that something is wrong with her and she hasn't been very happy about it. We're very happy with the experience. I've been writing again. So that's good.\n",
            "Doctor: Sounds like to me you're really quiet burden with a lot of things.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you don't want to have to deal with it and I think you're kind of angry with having to deal with it. But then very guilty about being angry about having to deal with it and I think Amanda / dress dresses you're coming to ferebee to talk about stuff.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I always want to come to therapy and it's a mostly if I don't I feel worse but then it's actually like yeah, but now I have to actually do it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. Yeah, it's the yeah, or do you feel awful?\n",
            "Patient: I don't get that far. But yeah, I must go maybe.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, also sort of I really have to.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, I didn't do as much but it is much harder for me when we don't meet at soft and yeah, not all the time but a lot of the time.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, your schedules the same for the fall.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think so. Meaning a few times a week seems to be okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'll see if I can arrange the Wednesday. I mean I've tried a couple times and maybe there's\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah, that's okay.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure what's going to happen with Monica's job. Did I tell you about her possibly having to resign?\n",
            "Doctor: No.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. So this is like at the beginning of the week or the beginning of last week. I don't know no actually was last week the center. She works for is the founder of the CEOs kids there. so before he started he likes checked it out with it at 6 commission to be like hey is this going to be a conflict of interest and they said no just rest recuse yourself from anything to do with that and he checked it out again and initially they said no it's fine and then they said we're going The the statement saying that you need to either cut all ties or resign not just from the race for governor, but also being a senator so she went to work one day last week and was like, I'm going to have it. I'm going to have to cool it like he's going to resign today. He didn't end up resigning but like in the next month he's going to basically figure out what he can do about it. So, I don't know. What's going to happen with their job? Which means that I don't know what's going to happen to my job. You know, I think it's sort of a thing. Who are like, I think they're going to try to keep me so I don't know. I'll have to look for another job, but I could stay up worrying about that but there's so many other things and that's something that's really really not in my control. The problem. Is that more I like if I say, I don't want to deal with something. I feel like I just become more of a burden to other people. So it just doesn't look particularly James, but then like things aren't great between us right now, and I just don't want to deal with it. Like it's sort of a new sensation for me or not wanting to just feeling that I just don't have the energy for that. Like I'm not thinking I don't know we have to fix this right away. And I just we didn't we did finally make an appointment with a couples counselor. I think he's going to be able to start like in September.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, I'm really glad about that. But that's what I feel. Like there'll be the same thing as like it'll be really good to have done and then we'll have to do it and then\n",

            "Patient: like that's just how life is it's hard.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm trying to think of. To say how hard it is. I imagine if it feels like you should just learn to deal with how hard it is. You shouldn't have to lay it on somebody else by talking about how hard it is.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I feel badly because it doesn't seem to me that it can possibly it doesn't seem like it is hard for other people and I realize that like, I don't know other people. I don't realize how hard it is for them. But yeah, I don't think other people want to quit life on a regular basis because they just don't Because I just don't because of doing the dishes and it doesn't make me feel like I don't feel like I sort of feel sorry for myself. But more of why can't I just deal with things these normal things. This is just hot like this.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: Why can I just deal with it? Because I don't think my life is actually harder than most people's.\n",

She just doesn't want to wear her other clothes and I sort of don't know what to do. I really I really know what you're going through is Selena. I really understand on the other hand. You're just going to have to where these other clothes like just like that's just how it goes.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess I it strikes me in different ways. Why don't think you're feeling a bit that way with me like. I don't want to fucking wear these clothes but like the way things are I don't like that. I don't want to be on top of everything. I don't like that. I want to quit and give up. I don't like that. I feel so burden Lake.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah a little bit.\n",
            "Doctor: And so I kind of imagined that there's something sort of historically revelance there where Selena has you and her parents to help her with that. She doesn't want to wear her clothes. We're going to sit there and we're going to get her to wear them somehow, but you'll help her you'll be more or less patient with her. You'll try different fix whatever and you'll see this. Is like okay. This is what a three-year-old does like. She's going through a phase like boohoo. We'll we'll try this will try that, you know some combination try and the straps are trying to force her trying to bribe her trying to do the laundry more and just losing patience with her.\n",
            "Patient: Behind. Yeah, that's all right.\n",
            "Doctor: That's kind of like be with her and some extent. I don't know. I guess I can imagine that maybe you didn't have that.\n",
            "Patient: I don't remember I mean thinking more generally but I don't remember anyone talking to me about my clothes much. I mean, that's what it feels like anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess part of where I'm a part of what I'm saying was I think it and I mean it sincerely by the way, but this it feels like you like such a large like kind of essential problem to not wanting to be doing these things. It's so burdensome and yet so dangerous to not do them.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Answer like my complete vanity about it is that she won't feel that way because she's got you and her parents to help her feel like it's livable in like survive and it sucks, but it doesn't end the world.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so are you saying that a lot of my distress at not wanting to deal with my life and having to do with my life and having to deal with my life comes through as I don't know how to resolve that or that I don't know how to resolve that.\n",
            "Doctor: Guess what I'm saying is\n",

I think I get to the point where I am trying to sort of take the next step and work things out and I don't know say something intelligent. I I just gets too hard.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, we did.\n",
            "Doctor: I lasted about 30 minutes or so. I was not able to record it at the time. Would you mind sharing what happened how you felt what we did what you did and what happened afterwards? and then we can talk about your homework and everything since\n",
            "Patient: So yes, we didn't have. A Morton prompt session on Friday night. Basically what it related to was the fact that I think I mentioned in the past and some of the recordings that I just had a recent surgery and in addition to having shoulder surgery and trying to recover from some very very painful processes. I was having other pain and numbness and tingling shooting down my arm, very concerning things happened. And what ends up happening was I received a in Mir MRI report on Friday that showed I had a herniated disc in my cervical spine in my next to say To the say the least it's been taking steroids and doing all of these things. And so I found you on Friday evening because a friend of mine when I was explaining what was going on just sort of giving him the lowdown he proceeded to tell me that I was too young. He says I'm way too young to have a herniated disc.\n",
            "Doctor: He's a medical doctor.\n",
            "Patient: I know he's definitely not.\n",
            "Doctor: He's definitely not that's a significant point.\n",
            "Patient: Definitely not. So he said I was too young and then proceeded to tell me about his boss and how his boss had a herniated disc in how he had free steroid injections that surgery is definitely the next up because he plays golf and he's active and he's not following the right plan and how I should definitely go and see his chiropractor and then he's saying a lot of different things that he told me he was going to speak with the chiropractor to see if I can get in there doctor whatever-his-name-is for free because he told me he charged seventy-five and I said I didn't really want to be spending about right now. I'll wait thank you very much. I'll see my doctor on Tuesday. Then he proceeded to call me back and Sheriff. He said would you like the good news first or the bad news? And I said, of course the bad news and he said Well the bad music it's permanent and you have to wear a brace at a neck brace for two years.\n",
            "Doctor: Your friend the non doctor told you this.\n",
            "Patient: My friend the 9 doctor said this so I love myself to get into a state of Hysteria because for whatever reason we don't have to get into it that I guess but I felt very desperate.\n",
            "Doctor: I think it would be good for you to identify what contributed to your feeling hysterical.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I think I turned to listen to people that I think are very smart and I will look at them.\n",
            "Doctor: Listen or listen and believe.\n",
            "Patient: Listen and believe what they say and if they say something that sounds like if they're highly intelligent person even when they're not highly intelligent if they say it with conviction. It's like I'm sometimes tend to just feel like it's the word of God. Like if you're saying less than it must be the case. It's this very extreme. It's very exaggerated an\n",
            "Doctor: Jessa I have a fantastic bridge I can tell you it's called the Brooklyn Bridge and I can sell it to you at a great price.\n",

            "Patient: No, thanks.\n",
            "Doctor: Well done. I'm glad you're not a hundred percent gullible.\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm not I make my own decisions. I have my own distraction, but I think that when I'm feeling desperate, I think it's more of that.\n",
            "Doctor: When you're when you're making yourself desperate by telling yourself what?\n",
            "Patient: But I'm never going to be the same again and very many shoulds and must and all those things.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you do you tell yourself? I must find the answers. I must find the solution.\n",
            "Patient: I'm very very frustrated at this point because the pain is just the debilitating. I've been feeling it since April and I was sick last year for a. Of 3 months and I just started to feel better from really really ill and I wasn't able to walk and was so down. I felt like I had a good number of months, but it was still teetering on any amount. You know, there was still fear. Of course, I was traumatized by what a matter or I'll say it was it re BP way, I traumatized myself what happened, but regardless Of that it was still very huge pivotal point in my life and then heard I got better and actually meant like had a girlfriend and everything pretty much 3 months later all of this started to happen.\n",
            "Doctor: the physical symptoms\n",
            "Patient: Physical symptoms of my mom arms and stuff like that a few years back before I even got sick. I was in physical therapy for per years because I was able to walk and started having some really bad back stuff.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, but now I let us get back to look at your feelings of Hysteria on Friday night.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like I get this from Shirts by all my issues. I don't want to blame what's happening in my life. In other words all these issues. I was the way I was before if that makes sense.\n",
            "Doctor: Can you clarify?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I've always been someone who's very hard on myself.\n",
            "Doctor: until now\n",
            "Patient: Oh, really?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, can you predict the future?\n",
            "Patient: No fun. So yeah until now yes, this would be wonderful if I could change I mean if anyway.\n",
            "Doctor: No, wait, have we not already seen some changes for the better in your attitude to yourself?\n",
            "Patient: maybe a little bit but I still feel like I'm extremely I feel like I'm still sort of up and down with these sort of things because it takes\n",
            "Doctor: Right, you're human. Just her just to remind you. There have been times recently. I've been I've acknowledged your good effort and you thanked me but in the first week, we had a session you seem to to really not be able to let yourself taking positive feedback and then in later weeks you did. So I did I certainly have observed changes. There's evidence that your positive changes possible you and I have agreed that you're getting better at catching your shoulds. Your language is change your speaking in language that indicates you're taking responsibility for your emotion rather than blaming the circumstances. For example when you say I make myself hysterical So there is progress now back to Friday night.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, so then you spoke to me and I have to say thank you for that because it definitely helped in the moment when I was in the store of state of Mass hysteria it definitely I felt calm after our talk and everything.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure. Now what it was that allow you to change your desperation to Congress.\n",
            "Patient: Dizziness, are you were able to show me about it? Wasn't that my friend? You maybe didn't make the best choices and didn't really think of me before he spoke wasn't the truth. Or God that whatever he shared with me was not number one wasn't even accurate. And number two is in the scheme of everything that's going on. It's so nice. You can look at the Ridiculousness of the way. She was speaking to me that he was oh because he did say that at one point educated I said, how do you know all of this about a herniated disc and he said well and educated and I'm like, oh, so I'm not like, I don't know anything. So it's it was funny because thinking back when you made a couple comments like how he's the only the doctor he was going to recommend like he was the only Doctor Who can possibly help me a definition light on the fact that yeah, this is not the only I think I'm very much into putting things into meat little box. Which life is not about does not like that? and there should be one answer and that one person is right in that they have all the answers and I know deep down that that's not it but when I got into certain situations that tend to come up for me where I feel dependent upon what somebody says or doesn't say, it's like talkin seeking the ownership that I make decisions as well even just now the way coming back from work my father's already like How are you feeling? Are you going to see the neurologist? He got somewhere back pain and issues and if I ever say to him like Dad, maybe you should try. Not should but maybe look into getting Physical Therapy. He would say I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. That was interesting because he was sharing with me that this is what he thought I should do. You should go call your neurologist you should and then I said, there's no point. I don't need to follow up with him and go back in there the new doctor. I'm seeing on Tuesday.\n",
            "Doctor: tomorrow\n",
            "Patient: Tomorrow. Yes, I explained that to him and he's like, okay I said, you know how you get when you get frustrated. I'm not really ready to talk right now because that's when when he's in pain Jose, I'm cranky. So basically I shared with him that I just wasn't really feeling up to it and thought I was having a cranky feeling.\n",
            "Doctor: So you were quite absurd.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I was I didn't really think about it like that.\n",
            "Doctor: Think about it.\n",
            "Patient: okay, so I was\n",
            "Doctor: Sounds like it to me reflect on what you just told me.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, I guess I was it feels foreign.\n",
            "Doctor: In the past you have not found it at all easy to be assertive with your parents.\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't find it easy at all. It's like my hardest thing.\n",
            "Doctor: And you just described to me that you are sort of with them moments ago without even indicating that it was a great achievement. In other words. It sounds like you were able to let yourself State the truth in an assertive way.\n",
            "Patient: O c I thought I was a bitch.\n",
            "Doctor: oh, well, it isn't that interesting interesting notice notice yourself of valuation telling your father what you think and feel make\n",
            "Patient: That's my go to my go to I have to I end up allowing myself to feel guilty when he's being caring and telling me what he thinks I should do and I don't go with it.\n",
            "Doctor: From what you told me I didn't I didn't hear any bitch like sentences or you leaving out a whole whole lot of verbal abuse that you showered on him.\n",
            "Patient: No, I was actually on the bus and I'm like, I'm really cranky.\n",
            "Doctor: So notice how easily you can be hard and about in value 18 yourself and surprise surprise. I said the light on it right now so you can be more aware.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. It was just so funny.\n",
            "Doctor: So back to Friday night, so you made yourself Hysterical by taking too. Seriously what your friend and we agreed on Friday night that your friend has drama queen Tendencies and a doctor. He is not in a spike that we took his word seriously and you built them are out of all proportion it in your mind and cat has taught us both eyes and horrible eyes, and it was lucky when you called that and it was lucky when you called that I was available for that time for us to talk.\n",
            "Patient: I'm very lucky.\n",
            "Doctor: And we were able to gather to put things in perspective. You were able to laugh you were able to make a practical practical plan and at least clarify that the Practical plan you considered already with efficient reminding yourself that tomorrow Tuesday. You were going to a doctor a real doctor so that you can speak to someone who has a medical degree. And we'll see what happens from there.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: So when we finish our short session on Friday night, you were considered considerably calmer and experiencing less emotional pain and the goal. We spoke about was to take it easy for the weekend. Today is Monday. Today is Monday. So, how was your weekend? Did you wash your stinking?\n",
            "Patient: I did a little bit. But when I went to my friend my close friend who lives in the building, I love him went to her to her Halloween party and there was seeing a lot of friends that I hadn't seen in a while and I think I sort of had to put on a happy face. I didn't have but I chose to put on like a happy face and make it seem like I was feeling I mean this so clearly that I wasn't feeling well, but I didn't have a neck brace on and I felt maybe if I just asked if I'm feeling okay that it will come out that way. I felt like it took a lot of energy and a lot of effort. So when I came home late Saturday, I was there with my girlfriend. I felt like I had he comes I was really getting upset I felt like Starting to a stop. I don't know what I should say here. But it feels like it's not should but I feel like it's affecting my relationship as well. Just my feeling very depressed. It's hard for me because it's a new relationship. It's hard for me to sort of weed out if it's the relationship or if it's me in the relationship. You can't blame one person for our relationship goes but I feel that the rolls have become almost that I could play. Well, it's me I'm upset and I don't feel well and my girlfriend said in friends comes to like it's going to be okay. And I feel it now starting to trickle into other aspects of my life to the point where I feel like there is a part of me. That's just that feels Jessa. Would you be okay to not even be in a relationship right now because it's still new it's not like a married or in a significant relationship is 25 years is brand new. And so to me it's taking on. I feel like I'm allowing it to see been to a lot of other aspects.\n",
            "Doctor: allowing what to seep into other aspects\n",
            "Patient: My upset in my disturbance over the pain and over my depression, I guess if that's what you want to call it or of just feeling like everyday is hard.\n",
            "Doctor: So there are few things that just have come up and what you said. There's the area of your girlfriend being in the nurture and Roll But and you didn't say what I'm about to say, am I accurate and interpreting or entering that you're not comfortable being in a roll of more of a receiver and a sense am I wrong?\n",
            "Patient: No, you're right.\n",
            "Doctor: So behind that there is I should mostly be bright Paws and both positive cheerful self.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: So it's not surprising if you're so hard on yourself and then not comfortably unconditionally accepting yourself that it would be easy to find it difficult to receive unconditional acceptance from another when you're not being Miss perky cheerful. Happy bright Jesup.\n",
            "Patient: exactly\n",
            "Doctor: In your assessment. I haven't heard from you that she's complaining.\n",
            "Patient: No, she's been complaining. She will told me, you know, if I'm ever in a situation you would do the same that I would be there and I would and then of course the end my issue is I think but I don't think I can't think about that right now. I just have to get better myself. I don't want to think about you having an issue. It's like this this to this extent. I just want to think about the fact that you are that you care and love me despite this and that it's not defending that who I am or defending who we are. It's just part of what's going on right now, but that doesn't have to be so humdrum, but then I feel badly because I know she's being put on So I also know she has a choice in a sense that she doesn't have to stay in the this relationship. So I think that it's a whole mixed bag of things, but I think that a lot of it does come for me feeling that I might be like that regardless.\n",
            "Doctor: Might be like what?\n",
            "Patient: Regardless of whether I had this all this stuff going on right now because in past relationships when I didn't have this I did feel that I had to be bright cheerful happy a peach. Otherwise, it was very extreme. It's like I'm either I can relate back to what I think maybe it comes from\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: I think it does have to do a lot with the fact that I didn't I felt my mother was very loving towards me when I was in a good mood and when I was down or upset she would push it right away and say you're complaining and I don't want to hear it and when my mom used to say that you're like a doormat and so there's no empathy really beautiful what it would maybe you ask for like 2 or 3 minutes and then I would get that Embassy for 2 or 3 minutes like oh wow, you really do understand and then it was just like you're going to be fine. Like what like quickly let's just move on. I don't have time for this type of thing. That was her attitude when I was good. She was nice and when she disapproves I think I see that in me now, but it's like I have to put on the sort of Sasuke but everything's great because it's the only way I think I'm going to get\n",
            "Doctor: rewarded\n",
            "Patient: Rewarded. Yeah\n",
            "Doctor: well now at your age.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",

I don't even want to say it should but that it would be beneficial for the person doing it to be bright intelligent person. Or do you think that just any old Average Joe off the street could apply these techniques?\n",

Almost like a light bulb went off after Session 5 because I I see it Bordeaux, but I like to consider myself somebody of high intelligence. I think that it is just interesting. I mean maybe everybody interprets things differently, but I would be curious to know and did I have that thought that somebody who is just I don't even want to say of average intelligence really, but let's just say very basic IQ functioning and this would even make sense to you know, it is\n",

            "Patient: Okay, nothing bad is going to happen.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe it is going to be challenging, but maybe it won't be.\n",
            "Patient: All right.\n",
            "Doctor: So is that voice of I should be doing this right or should be easier coming up? What are you going to tell that?\n",

            "Doctor: All right now dispute.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, okay despite at this time and I'm experienced some health issues. This is obviously a challenge in my life at this point. It is not something I'm jumping up and down excited about at the same time. There is an end in sight because nothing last forever. and it is okay that but I do feel the way that I do right now in the sense that\n",

            "Patient: Okay, the medication will take the edge off but it is not accurate at all. And there are other things that I can do to make sure I have to speak with the doctor and speak with a professional and speak about what the next steps are because medicine is never Patriot Pincus. It's a way of eating to make me feel better. It's not going to cure fix the entire situation. There are other aspects to making this journey a little bit easier and I'll get to that when I speak with someone who knows more about a herniated disc, but I haven't even had that opportunity as of yet. So when I do I'm hopeful that I'm able to have a little more resolution and not just feel uneducated in the terms of what to do next like next steps.\n",
            "Doctor: So therefore it is awful and terrible that you not found the perfect solution to your Melodies and that you're still suffering some physical consequences.\n",

I've been hopeful I think that there are probably some nerve and nervousness about going to the doctor tomorrow because it's almost like if I haven't addressed it yet. I haven't heard anything. So it's almost like that no news is good news, but I want to see cancers because\n",
            "Doctor: And you're taking action? Okay, so more disputed. Let us get back to that.\n",

            "Patient: that was the thought.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes dispute.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. No, but then I had another thought that I was terrible for not contacting you to let you know that I was running late. So which one do you want me to spume? Okay, it was more that. First one it was more that one.\n",
            "Doctor: dispute dispute\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so it's soon it is certainly part of my life to be late. Sometimes when you're dependent upon public transit Transportation coming from a job.\n",

I forgot that piece that last piece of it. The last piece is I think the country because you have other thoughts, but then at the end of the thought is that which I shouldn't be which I must do which is the conscious thought like it is it is one that ties up ties it up on me.\n",

            "Doctor: so it is tough. You say try. All right talk to me will exchange rules. I should have called you Jessa when I was going to be late and makes me an irresponsible. No good person. I feel disgusting. I feel I'm not acting adult enough. I I just feel depressed.\n",
            "Patient: Okay. Okay Debbie. Are you aware right now? But that is quite okay, but you didn't reach out in that.\n",
            "Doctor: Shouldn't I be more responsible?\n",
            "Patient: I mean, it would be nice if you were able to make a phone call, but if you were in the middle of transportation and couldn't get to doing it, I'm sure that Debbie I'm talking if I'm talking to you.\n",

            "Doctor: You tell me the probable answer.\n",
            "Patient: Probably because I've never done this before so it's new.\n",
            "Doctor: And this idea that you and we went over this before that you should be able to do it by now. We went over this it is.\n",
            "Patient: I know it is.\n",

This is where I challenge myself in the most making sure that I appear that I do everything responsibly and so it is most almost like pulling off a veneer. and that is why I don't really want to do this one because it feels like oh Debbie Ashley did know that I was struggling to get across town and that I wasn't going to call but it almost feels like a cover like I'm going to wedding this but that is that I'm not perfect and I\n",

            "Patient: Yes. So I apologize for not being able to come up with the perfect answer for her right now, but that is obviously how I torture myself throughout the day. So and also I really don't know what to say. I don't know how to dispute that one. And I don't know why I don't know how to dispute it.\n",
            "Doctor: Which one?\n",
            "Patient: The last one about the phone call. I feel like the doctor was easy. That was easier to dispute the one about me feeling like I shouldn't be feeling this was easier. But one with the phone call really hurt hurt. It is really hard.\n",
            "Doctor: So what so it is hard?\n",
            "Patient: But I don't even have an answer.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, you started to dispute it get back to it. What is the irrational belief and then dispute it?\n",
            "Patient: The irrational belief is that you're not going to like me anymore if I don't get here on time and that you're going to not want me to come back and that you're going to be finished with this because you thought I was being irresponsible, but I wasn't here as I should be worse possible because I arranged you the session with you.\n",
            "Doctor: the first of all, were you aware that all those assumptions are self created by you because\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm not aware of that now. I guess I am because you just pointed out.\n",
            "Doctor: okay.\n",
            "Patient: But I was not aware of that.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, can you read my mind? So how can you assume with certainty that I have those attitudes that you assumed I would have none of which I do or by the way or would have by the way.\n",
            "Patient: How can I I can't\n",
            "Doctor: Well notice that you told me that you believed in your drama queen friend who is not a doctor was telling you you're going to be paralyzed for the rest of your life.\n",

            "Doctor: So time is moving on and we're not going to have time now.\n",
            "Patient: Or maybe you just borrow the pain. I want to just write a few things done to remind myself.\n",

            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, so you haven't disputed all of the irrational beliefs that you came up with you came up with a good many well done with that. And in the interest of time just working now on those ones you did to see it in the last 10 minutes.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Come up with the active new philosophy in relation to the irrational beliefs that you've disputed.\n",

            "Patient: I can't believe I've been like this for 35 years and never knew. And I didn't and I didn't recognize what have you been doing. Just a you went to Farabee you you went to school for this. You should know more. Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: So are you willing to accept that up until this recent point you haven't known more because if you had no more you might have done things differently, but here we are. The past is the past.\n",

            "Patient: Baby helpful for me in order to be happier and not to feel this enormous amount of pressure that I never realized I did until now which is astonishing to tell you the truth. I can't lie about it and I think like anything I guess. With overtime you build a different mantra.\n",
            "Doctor: If you put that in the effort.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Which takes first awareness and catching the old habitual thoughts and actions in challenging not leaving them on question.\n",

            "Doctor: It can be enlightening if you choose to see that it see it that way the situation on Friday night where you unthinkingly took literally didn't question what the guy told you in the result was hysteria and then when you stopped and thought about it, you felt a calm within you felt calm within a very short time.\n",
            "Patient: It was a short time in the good news. I know we have to come to an end. Now in the session with a good news was that I did actually speak to him the next day and he was angry at me because I did actually read reach out to tell him that I was going to the doctor and I used your tactic to tell him that I wasn't going right away. It was an hour and a half before I was still just really over what had happened to did really feel like calling him and I did actually he reached out to me and I said I want to let you know that as much as you might see you knew about the new a lot about a herniated disc. Thank you for sharing. I did do some research myself and as much as he thought x y and z Wasn't exactly what you said. So next time baby just be a little more cautious before you start sharing information with people that you think might be in their best interest but really isn't what is the reality? And I was pretty assertive with him which is new for me. So I guess if I want to focus on what I did, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well done.\n",

If he could do another performance like that to give you the opportunity to assess how much you're going to take him seriously or not and to give you the opportunity to not upset yourself. However, we so we shall see what will be will be but the important thing now is to keep on practicing your awareness and help the willingness to continue to be gentler on gentler on yourself in Unconditionally accepted and at peace with you as an improper imperfect human being like the rest of us. An imperfect human being who is blessed with many gifts, by the way. There's not about not enjoying your assets. Celebrate them enjoy them.\n",

            "Patient: I think what actually would be helpful instead of focusing on the shud the musk and writing that down. I think talking about it how you did with the next step like going that next level because I think it's important for me to really get the concept that it's not just I should be like it's not so simple as I should be a good student it is if I'm not like in other words all the worst possible putting it all out there in terms of what I really think not just going by the books and looking at Homework of\n",

Well, meaning that I in other words if you give me homework, you know, my thought already It is Well, you don't because you're not a psychic but you kind of get the theme of how I think which is that I should do my homework in so if I'm doing it, I'm doing it to give to you like I did my work or I'm doing it because I'm really investigated where the sort of the thought sort of goes astray that It is so I think the best for me right now would be to investigate to see to really stop and think and go through it instead of just anyone can write down a bunch of I should have be perfect. I should be that is so easy that that is not\n",

            "Patient: So I want a couple of days ago, but all of my friends are depressed like all of them and I was talking to Lucy about this about how you know, I had plans with Yvonne later this week and I was really dreading it because you Vons miserable about the divorce and she feels like her life is over, but she's behind on work. She does freelance writing and she also has a day job like 25 hours a week. I like whenever we hang out. It's just constant stream of like I can't write I'm so blogged. I have all these projects. They're all kind deadline. I feel so terrible. My house is a shithole, but no don't help me clean it because I'm too embarrassed to anyone help me clean it, but I'm just going to tell you about how miserable I am that it's a shithole while we're sitting in the middle shithole while I'm sitting while I'm sitting Legos literally because I can't put them away because I would shame her feel like there are no places to sit that aren't covered in walking Legos. And like her kid is misbehaved, but then she doesn't discipline your kid. I'm also watching her like actively not just wondered yet while her kid is misbehaving while she's telling me that she's so miserable with that hurricane is missing hate that are kid misbehaves and like it's just literally draining and horrible, you know. Lazy parrot are you familiar with the spoon metaphor for energy?\n",
            "Doctor: I'm not.\n",
            "Patient: So some disability activists row about it to describe what it's like to live with lupus and it's just this. But like you have these physical tokens, let's call them spins. Like you're holding a handful of spoons from the silverware drawer and every action you do requires you to give up a stew and when you're out of the handful of spoons, you're just done for the day. You can't do anything more. You can't go out. You can read them that you can't cook dinner.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, you're done.\n",
            "Patient: Done. These are burned so like\n",
            "Doctor: It stinks.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so the metaphor is you know, how many spoons do you have? Are there a lot of spoons Lucy made me the analogy that he our Kevon is like having you gone take all of the screens and drop tops and down the garbage disposal and that I should not make myself the picture on mater of the horribly mangled spoons drop down the disposal. She kind of had a point. But like I tell her I care about her and want Briley every one I lean on for emotional support is also like horribly depressed and feels like their life is spinning out of control is miserable. Last night I had a long last night. I had an hour long conversation with my friend Vanessa that just gotten 10-year last week. I feel like years of working towards it but she feels like a failure because she had some publishing papers and she had a sub down from like some leadership position in our department and she's going through another divorce if I get a severely autistic because your kids therapist have been embezzling the entrance for like 6 years the government decided that all of his therapist patient. We're going to be denied Services because they're not really sick and she has to restart the whole evaluation and diagnostic process over with a new therapist. I was like, she's got a lot of horrible circumstances going on like she spent an hour literally telling me about she's an academic failure, which he's got tenure. She's deeply depressed like borderline suicidal a depressed and I don't really know what I can do to help her other than make her sure to go find a therapist of her own which I've been doing. But it's not helping me at all like spend an hour on the phone with someone who is telling me in detail about their suicidal ideation. But you know, this is the one I've been friends with for a long time and I can see if I care about Yeah, I don't none of my friends are happy and that sucks. I really miss Ashley and I realized a part of it while I mean part of it just that you know, I'm still half in love with her and part of it is, you know, the physical and sexual aspects of the relationship and certainly part of it was in spite of knowing intellectually that he was really depressed and miserable and has been for quite a while. He fakes being okay really? Well. So when we were on date to pretend everything was normal and you talk about his depression the way all of my other friends did.\n",
            "Doctor: well one thing that seems to be but that seems to be true in the way you're describing Yvonne and Vanessa sort of talking to you. You'd also know you're talking about it is. It's a little more show than tell. You know, like what you've on you see it all over the place.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Any sort of see it demonstrated how she talks?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: But it's not exactly what she's talkin. I don't know if it's what you talkin about or not.\n",
            "Patient: No, it is. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: How so?\n",
            "Patient: Like I mean, she'll talk about how she's feeling about how she'll say, you know, I'm miserable because Christopher is yelling at me to move my stuff out of his apartment faster. I really can't because I don't have any because I don't have the time and have this job and I'm behind on my deadlines and it feels miserable that I'm behind on my deadline every time I sit down to write I have panic attacks and I'm just on the floor crying and then she sang this shall be like crying and it's just yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. I guess something related to that. I like that. Vanessa is a spoon metaphor. I'm sorry Lucy spoon metaphor is the garbage disposal doesn't digest spoon to just mangle song.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And there's kind of that feeling what you're describing like. Vanessa and you seem kind of mangled like they're not the stuff is just raped.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And what they're saying is rapping you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not like this may be happening, but it's not the fact that you're describing that like their feeling to get is getting metabolized.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Or you're helping them metabolize it it's just like you're getting all mingled.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: what what's happening to you and\n",
            "Patient: Like I wonder if there isn't just some kind of feedback link going on that we're all depressed and we all have stressful unhappy things going on. Just do I laying on it with each other. It's just kind of exacerbates the negative feeling for all of us. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it almost makes me think that maybe feels like something similar here, but you kind of say these things but it does feel like I'm really taking in or in some way helping you with how kind of overwhelming support of chewed up here feeling all this. Like you're saying it and it's spinning around and around more than it is like feeling as though kind of like it's going anywhere and I imagine part of how that works is. Probably let there's something it feels like I know you may be missing about what this feels like to you to be listening to them.\n",
            "Patient: Like it's exhausting and I'm guilty for being exhausted by it. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: amorth sounds gut-wrenching, you know, I mean And there's something very parallel. That seems like almost charistic of a way that it is disturbing. How old is Yvonne? He's kid like 5 or something.\n",
            "Patient: 5 or 6 or something like that. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean to see a kid that age and that's for the vertebral out of control. With a mother who so passive and helpless.\n",
            "Patient: Right, will the kid's father isn't any better and neither of them discipline sir? And in part because we both came from abusive authoritarian household. And so they're both terrified that they\n",
            "Doctor: They're reacting. Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: If they ever like saying no or X or any discipline or try to take control of her behavior in any way that they'll tip over the line and she abusive with her.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm really not this Probably sounds weird, but my intent is not to be critical of her as mom so much as to say I imagine. It's terribly disturbing to watch.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And more so because you both know it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Like she's not containing the kid at all.\n",
            "Patient: I know and it's like super frustrating when we hang out and like when she has a kid because we can't actually have a grown-up conversation because the kid interrupts like every 30 seconds and needs constant attention.\n",
            "Doctor: Right and that's expectable for like a two or three year old but not so much with a six-year-old.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, well, what's your three year olds you expect them to be asleep by 9 at night which medicine didn't like they've never had a consistent bedtime for her either which doesn't help. I've been over at their place like when we split up at like 11:30 midnight and the kid would still be awake and hanging out watching TV and it's just like not I don't know what they're going to do when they have to start school in the fall.\n",
            "Doctor: Does the mom or yeah, the mom does have a therapist.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: The therapist or something need to file. But that's not really. Yeah, and you probably feel like you go over there pretty much any hour and the kid is likely up.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and like in the past I tried saying, you know Madison I'm having a grown-up calm conversation with your mom. Please don't interrupt like not stepping into a role of disciplining her but like speaking to her. I went to another adult like I'm having conversation. Can you hang on a minute?\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: And then the kid just has a total meltdown and says, you know goes into a total kid mode of you're not the boss of me. You're not my mom. You can't tell me what to do. I want to talk to my mom and then it just like a zillion times worse. It just it's just like there's no I mean, I guess there is no reasoning with you know, a kindergarten so no matter what\n",
            "Doctor: 13B I mean a kid who's heard that 300 times before is probably about the number they're going to be going to have heard it most of the time like from a parent, you know, you can say that and they're like, okay, I mean, you know neither really worked out or something, but you can say it.\n",
            "Patient: Again, one time leave before so I was over at their place for movie night and they were trying to just bleed to get the kids to go to bed and getting off during bedtime rituals why they were watching the movie which I thought was a little strange with a bedtime ritual lasted an hour and a half and there was the peeing the and the brushing teeth Method Man eating a snack. But the Bedtime ritual lasted an hour and a half and there was a p and a brushing the teeth and then demanding a snack when I'm brushing the teeth again and the demanding water the demanding a story and then coming out of the ground mending more water than wanting another story because now she's out of bed. And at one point she insisted she wanted me to reach her story. They both just kind of looked at me helplessly and you can reach her story, please. I was like, what the hell is this?\n",
            "Doctor: right right\n",
            "Patient: So I read the cat a story and then she didn't like the way I wrote the story. So I had to read it again using funny voices for the funny character. I was just like Jesus Christ.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And I feel bad criticizing their parenting because you know, I don't have kids myself. That way you never know what it's like to parent a difficult child until you have one and it's like I'm not there on the ground 24/7 with it, but it's not it's just it's destructive and stressful.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, but you have something there that's incredibly wrong.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, like it's destructive and it's stressful. Especially the kid starts shrieking like high-pitch loud wailing and it's just pitiful to be over there.\n",
            "Doctor: Parenting and regular little kid looks different from what they're doing. I mean it's not obvious from this but I mean I am a child trained and until a few few years ago. I saw kids, you know and parenting it can be incredibly hard and hard to know how hard it can be to parent a difficult it but that's not what it looks like, you know, if they were sort of going for the rich fool trying to get the limits and you know, whatever X Out or something and all of that the kids are still going nuts. That's one thing as a kid was autistic and they like had some elaborate structure that the kid could not fit into but they're trying you know, that would be one thing or if the kid was incredibly anxious and just comes out of bed every 10 minutes because they're you know, what's right of A ghost or something in there short of gentle, but firm that's different. This is not that\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean it didn't sound like they had anything.\n",
            "Patient: No.\n",
            "Doctor: And that yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And like I'm sure it's just in Yvonne that we hang out on nights when she doesn't have the kid but on nights when she doesn't have the kids. She's usually like going to lectures or like going to events that she's going to be reporting on or in the office late working. So she doesn't want to hang out or nice that she doesn't have Madison. I've tried suggesting will just hire babysitter. I'll pay for the babysitter. Let's go out for dinner. But you know and she's like, well, you know Madison only sees me part of the time. I don't really want the babysitter and Christopher might use that against me in the divorce proceedings. She's worried that Christopher is going to try to get full custody of Madison with only supervised visits for her. Frankly. I kind of see her point and if I were Christopher I sure as hell would want full custody. with only supervised visits for her because she's not like Christopher is also permissive and doesn't discipline the kid, but at least like he keeps his house clean and the kid isn't living in\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Like yeah, like Yvonne actually told me I didn't witness this but Yvonne told me that you know, the kid had been sleeping on sheets that smells like piss for three nights because she don't have the spoons are energy to like wash your sheets after Madison peed on them again. And she hoped that maybe now Madison will learn a lesson about peeing in the bed having to sleep in piss smell smelling sheets and I was just like so horrified so immensely horrified like sure you want to teach your kid not sweat the bed and since Madison had been sleeping completely drive for like 2 years like it's pretty clearly acting out because she's unhappy about the divorce, but the answer is not having your chicken sleeping sheet that smells like piss. That's like that's just awful.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And I know it wasn't like deliberately. She just really cannot cope with like doing another load of laundry, but still like yeah, it's Madison or my kid. I wouldn't want you gone to have you been full custody. And of course, I can't say that because I'm supposed to be on her side with a divorce and just\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: I'm sorry. This has been turned into like the third-party diagnosing of Yvonne's problems instead of talking about me.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think so. Actually I think things to me that part of what's the serving for you about watching Yvonne with her kid is like you're mixed sort of feeling or mixed sense of judging her thinking about how she should be doing things differently or better.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you know in that way I think yourself feeling kind of hopeless about the situation.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So I guess it seems to me that for you to feel more sure about how things there are fucked up and how she really should be responsible for her kid like she's being mean to her.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Probably reassuring for you. And I don't hear that the way you're putting it amounts towards her like it doesn't sound to me like you're saying this was the intent to be critical of her purse a more like I mean you're critical of how she is with her kid, but you're protected with the kid.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. I do feel almost like I'm litigating a case. You're like you're as all this evidence. I've collected and I'm presenting to you. Please validate that my feelings are not crazy. But like I'm supposed to go hang out with her in her house tomorrow night, but I'm already feeling anxious and upset about it and dreading going over there and like yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean this is I kind of feel like I mean, this is tricky like so the thing I'm sort of trying to get my head around here is there's a sort of perfection parallel. We're on a smaller scale your sort of presenting to me how you feel unable to manage things with her? So that you can't become like Disturbed you're overwhelmed and unhappy in the way that you can't control by seeing her obviously with parallel is with you know her doing the same thing to you with the kid like in the instance your me. She's you and the kid is the kid.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: and also clearly you know, what's going on here is much smaller scale because she's an adult, you know, she's not your kid, but It seems to me that both like yeah, I think you're probably right. There's a way in which year wanting me to kind of just validate but also like Tippin and encourage your rights her to protect yourself from them, you know, either by telling her that you don't want to see her or you don't want to see her without the babysitter or though you don't necessarily think our kids should be with the ex that you know, you don't feel like you'd be her friend. If you didn't tell her you thought you could handle her kid, you know. You shouldn't handle her kid, whatever some kind of limit. That would also help protect you but\n",
            "Patient: Well, like part of me is also frustrated because she didn't take my advice when Christopher first asked for the divorce. I told her you need a lawyer. You need to split the assets. Now, you need to have a bank account in your name and she didn't listen. She was like Christopher and I were together for 10 years and he loves me and he cares about me and he wouldn't screw me over now. He's like not giving her the password to the joint account. Like you changed the password won't give it to her drained at the most of the funds and private account for him. And Mike is a shuttle asshole and she was trying to negotiate with him and his On her own and like she's been like she has screwed herself over financially and even though she has legal counsel. I'm like she's not going to get as much Financial ER\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: And now she's complaining to me about how she screwed financially and she didn't text back. This was Christopher. I was like I told you four months ago that you needed a lawyer.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: It's really hard for me not to respond to that with well you brought that on yourself. But like I feel I don't know. I feel like a jerk every time I tell her I think she's doing something wrong like she wanted couples counseling and she wanted to know why Christopher wanted to divorce and she I don't know from where I'm standing. It looks like she emotionally curse and belittle him into going into counseling with her. and you know Christopher said in counseling and he said before canceling and he has been very consistent about That he feels like their marriage has been emotionally abusive towards him and he just wants out and there's nothing she can do to convince him. Otherwise She made him do this like 10 week counseling program to try to repair the relationship anyway, and I tried telling her like this is not fair to him. Even if he is wrong about calling you abusive. I think he is and even if he's being a kind of a dick about this if you wants to be off the relationship he gets me out and he doesn't owe you an explanation. I'm like it would be nice. If you did out of respect for like 10 years you were together, but you know, he had to leave a relationship doesn't want we all have that right but where woman singer husband was forcing her to like try to repair the relationship when she wanted out you would both be infuriated and Yvonne was like but like he owes me he owes it to me and I was like, there's no I don't know it's or maybe he's not wrong about being emotionally in this relationship. I don't know he's got Minnesota from his parents. He has numerous problems.\n",

            "Patient: Oh, I just from the name. How are you?\n",
            "Doctor: Good. Thank you.\n",
            "Patient: I had another hard week. I just feel like since I've been coming here. I have become more detached. Like I just feel really alienated from Harold. I don't know. It's almost like I just you know, and I just feel really detached.\n",
            "Doctor: How do you link it to coming here in feeling more detached?\n",
            "Patient: The reason I came was to be more in touch with my feelings and be able to express my feelings. I imagine that's a scary thing for me so protections.\n",
            "Doctor: You're going in the other direction.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's what it feels like.\n",
            "Doctor: How's your picking?\n",
            "Patient: I can definitely okay. I think I can definitely tie it to getting worse than when I'm feeling more discharge, which is why I question whether is it is something similar to I know we talked about work about borderline personality disorder, and I know that they cut to feel something because they feel and I just think there's some of that there because I seem to do more picking when I'm more anxious and attached so it's I don't know I can't I don't want to know if I can say it's better to depend some days better some days not You know, I think the other thing is the feeling the first feeling that I think I can get in touch with his anger and I don't want to you know, Sheila. I just feel like this whole thing with hair or just has you-know-who up in me for a long time just angry at him not feeling well feeling depressed not enjoying his retirement not appreciating. I feel not appreciating everything due to what the situation is like for me. And so I don't quite know what to do with that.\n",
            "Doctor: And you were talking about it. I guess it's small piece, but certainly a piece of it is knowing that having lost her inheritance and retirement yourself through your family's loss in a vast amount of money.\n",
            "Patient: Yes. Yes. Kind of I kind of just accepted it. I haven't really dealt with it. I think I think Harold Express more. He was more in touch with being angry about that than I was. I don't know. I think at the same time I was more concerned about what my mother was going to do. So when it was all happening and then afterwards it was just now I think you're right. Now I want to retire I can't so it is an issue.\n",
            "Doctor: On a practical level which has deep emotional implications and feelings may be angry at your dad for not taking someone's advice for feeling angry at life for being so unjust.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'm not totally in touch with that because I also saw the same time that I'm lucky to have what I have and I know there are people that are a lot worse off than I am and I'll manage somehow I may have to work on 80, but I don't I mean if there is anger about that, I'm sure they're probably is I'm not in touch with it at all. I'm more feeling I'm feeling it more I think directed to hell because I feel like he has this opportunity. He's not really enjoying it and appreciating it the way I think I would and I also think that this being that I'm working full-time and he's working part-time and it's you know way less it's two days a week. Well, it's 4 days a week, but hours Wise It's maybe 12 hours a week. I just feel like that should make our life easier because Harold has time to do a lot of things that I'm still doing. I'm still cooking. I'm still doing the food shopping lot of times when I bring it up. He says, you know, why don't you ask me I say, why should I have to ask you? You know, I feel like it's things that has to be done but have to be done the second we both why should I be the one that has to say, you know take the garbage out because it's Tuesday.\n",
            "Doctor: You want to feel like he's tripping it even trying to take care of you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm still like, you know, I mean, I guess my image of Harold retiring was that there would be some more time for him to take care of me because or do things that would make our life easier. But you know, he's like going to the doctor's all the time and not feeling well all wonder he basically has been said he said\n",
            "Doctor: Ming-Ming, sorry\n",
            "Patient: He did go to the new psychologist and he did change his medication for depression that he takes he was talkin taking Wellbutrin and something else. They took him off that and put them on Zoloft. So, I don't know maybe that will help. I guess it's the part that whenever anything comes up about something. I haven't done or a negative to me. I just filled Like what I just feel like what about everything I do he says look, you know, I love you. You know, I respect you, you know, I would never do anything. I tried to explain to him that it doesn't matter. But if you do do something even if you don't need it, and it upsets me. I need to be able to give you that feedback and now he would say that's ridiculous. You're overreacting. So I think he heard that a little bit last night. I also think you know that he says my perception is not right really his reception is not right. It's like there's no point in trying to there are times I say, okay. I'm going to write it down on the calendar every day that Harold says that he doesn't feel well every day that he does this every day that he does that I don't do it and that he'll say that's your perception and you know, that's not true, you know, maybe once in a while, I do that. I'm mad at myself that I let the girl talk me into the dog.\n",
            "Doctor: you don't want the dog\n",
            "Patient: I like the dog. I don't want the responsibility. It's just another thing for me to have responsibility for.\n",
            "Doctor: Are you worried about sort of his physical limitations now what it will look like in the future.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, yeah, I thought about that for a long time. That he is, you know, basically going to be debilitated. He's not going to be able to do anything.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel like that? His limitations are going to get worse.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, definitely.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that an edible with arthritis?\n",
            "Patient: Well, I think it's inevitable because he has arthritis all over so he had one knee replaced and the other one needs to be replaced. They won't do it because it was such a bad experience the first time so that's just going to get worse. It's not going to get better Builders really bad, even though he's in physical therapy is seems not getting better. Yeah, I mean and the pain I just think it sucks. Well, I guess part of my Detachment is if I remove myself from it, I can be happy or you know, I can go out with my friends. I can do things, you know, maybe you know, it's just sort of came to me.\n",
            "Doctor: Is the Detachment itself cause you distress?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, it's the Detachment in the sex thing and the more I put an effort into trying, you know, like thinking about it and trying to do something about it the more it's on my mind all the time and basically ends up back burner, you know, so that I'm very where in the last few weeks. I haven't had much physical contact at all.\n",
            "Doctor: I guess there are a couple explanation for that one explanation is your in touch with being angry so you don't want physical contact?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, how does not understand that? I don't know. If men just don't understand that is serious part of feeling that way is because we're not being intimate. If you would just be more intimate we would be able to handle those kinds of things. But I see, you know, I understand what he's saying, but it doesn't work like that for me.\n",
            "Doctor: So what do you think of that? You're here to feel more in touch with your emotions that's having the opposite effect.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Is that I said, I don't think that's entirely true. I think that I've seen you be more in touch here, but what do you think that's about?\n",
            "Patient: I'm just assuming it's that same feeling that I know I've been there. I felt the intensity when I start to get in touch with whatever feelings it is I pushed away and it's just easier for me to probably just you what I've done my whole life from a child. It's easier for me to function and be somewhat together and find things I you know find enjoyment out of flies and without letting my feelings get in the way.\n",
            "Doctor: When you start feeling the intensity, what is that like?\n",
            "Patient: I haven't felt in a long time. Actually, it's just something bubbles up and I just can't stop crying.\n",
            "Doctor: the associated with feeling sad overwhelmed\n",
            "Patient: I don't know what it is. I wouldn't jump to say it sad. I think there is a sadness there but it just seems more than that. It's interesting. I was talking to my older sister and she said she is in one of her therapy experience has really gone touch with like this Primal really Primal hurt and sadness and anger.\n",
            "Doctor: What did you do? What did you think or feel when you heard that?\n",
            "Patient: I just remember that one time where I was in therapy and thought that it was possible that I could do this. I just remember leaving their one session and getting it to my car and just being his real and just like feeling like something's really hands and it was just, you know, about to happen.\n",
            "Doctor: Not memory about going to Virginia to the doctor in your mom taking your hand and you not wanting it is that in that memory Ru is it sort of an angry refusal or is it just like I'm not interested.\n",
            "Patient: No, it's kind of an aversion.\n",
            "Doctor: An aversion like almost a disgust.\n",
            "Patient: What?\n",
            "Doctor: I disgust response.\n",
            "Patient: Like I don't ya, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Don't touch me like crouching.\n",
            "Patient: I also felt that way when I was older and my father would try to be affectionate. He's not wasn't I don't think a very affectionate person but I had the same feeling about the charge.\n",
            "Doctor: What about it? Do you think was a verse of Tia?\n",
            "Patient: I know. I don't know. I know that I'm very in touch with that point. You know, my kids want me to touch them. You know, I'm just very in touch with how glad that makes me feel?\n",
            "Doctor: Radisson\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Because you're afraid that they would have the same response as you.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think we could try to get into that memory more?\n",
            "Patient: the doctor you mean\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm just wondering if there's a way we can kind of get into it more to see what you imagine. It felt like a version of such a measure of thoughts.\n",
            "Patient: I can I actually can think of it more with my father only because it was later. I was really young and I don't know what I really felt. I know I had an issue as I got older with my father wanting to do, you know, put his arm around me.\n",
            "Doctor: Would you start at Midway?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I could feel the aversion.\n",
            "Doctor: What would happen if you let him touch you?\n",
            "Patient: I didn't feel comfortable.\n",
            "Doctor: Did it feel like an invasion of your space or did it?\n",
            "Patient: I just didn't feel comfortable with at all. I'm just feeling something right now. I'm feeling sick.\n",
            "Doctor: You're feeling sex in your belly.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know what it is. I guess it feels good to be feeling something.\n",
            "Doctor: Revealing anything anywhere except for your belly. Is it a pressure or pain?\n",
            "Patient: I don't feel it now. It was just kind of anxiety.\n",
            "Doctor: Are there any worse than what you're feeling or what you're feeling.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I'm just sad and scared.\n",
            "Doctor: Does anything come to mind about what you're scared about?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know something about my father. I think just with this whole thing about potential abuse in July. I just couldn't help but have in the back of my mind to thank you know, that wasn't my father. I mean what if it was my father now? I'm just about to a blank.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you go there all at once or was it a gradual process?\n",
            "Patient: What?\n",
            "Doctor: Going back. Was it like a switch? I'm serious.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. What did it look like to you.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't know.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: What are the reason I ask is because I'm just really trying to kind of focus in and be very kind of attempted all this have had you had that feeling before in your belly or stomach. It seems like I have you had that feeling before is it usually associated with crying?\n",
            "Patient: I think somewhere just severe anxiety, which I don't get that often.\n",
            "Doctor: I know this is kind of an odd question. But what do you think is in there?\n",
            "Patient: Feelings there such a way. It's disconcerting to me that I could you know, maybe I'm saying that it wasn't gradual then but I just kind of I just turn it off.\n",
            "Doctor: Gradual or not, you know this about yourself.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I definitely know about myself. I think my whole life it was a comfortable place for me to be. I also maybe anger has always been the easiest feeling for me to express.\n",
            "Doctor: I couldn't tell you if you said Express or suppress.\n",
            "Patient: Express\n",
            "Doctor: Express that is what I was guessing. What did you think about anger? That made it easier?\n",
            "Patient: why I think anger sometime just makes your real feeling so it's not really a feeling necessarily I think with Harold. It's probably easier than dealing with how sad it is what his situation is what happened to his life. Why cats are also being detached serves my purpose. Well my situation with Harold because I don't have to walk around feeling upset all the time with that Harold is in pain or how old is a happy. He can't do certain things.\n",
            "Doctor: Right. That's the Adaptive part of you. The downside is that you're feeling those things could draw you closer to him.\n",
            "Patient: I know I understand. That's why I'm here I guess.\n",
            "Doctor: Or maybe I say that because that should be a question if you're afraid those feelings would actually push you away at least the anger part.\n",
            "Patient: What do you mean?\n",
            "Doctor: The sadness. I don't know. I'm just wondering, you know on one level. It makes sense. If you really allowed yourself to have those feelings you would feel close to him, but it feels like that's not the all of how it feels to you. Maybe those feelings. I don't know drive a wedge or making intolerable. There's something it makes you feel helpless.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I just thought about it and I don't know what made me think of this. But when I worked at Walter Reed hospital it was with with with kids like 12 kids and one of them was borderline personality disorder, you know, you spend your whole life time. They're trying to develop relationships with them. She was obviously very difficult one time. You know, I asked her what was going on and one time she actually told me and it was like, I don't want to know. Okay. Thank you. I will never ask a question again. That's just what came to my mind.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it the same feeling as your father wanted to put his arm around you?\n",
            "Patient: I think so.\n",
            "Doctor: I got this image of you. Just wanting to push something away.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: What did it feel like when she started telling you?\n",
            "Patient: It was like I couldn't even believe that anybody could have those going on inside their mind with their feelings. It was scary.\n",
            "Doctor: Did you feel scared for her or scared for you?\n",
            "Patient: Not really scared more like how can anybody live like that? How do you live with all that stuff going on inside?\n",
            "Doctor: Do you think that's why your mother left?\n",
            "Patient: Always my mother was very fragile even now she sees herself as being so self-aware. But it if I think if you ever really got anywhere got really got her to really look inside. I think she would fall apart. I think that's how she got through life is to have the same kind of attachment. She lost her mother. She hated her father because he was cheating on her mother and she blames him for her mother said she had a brother who died. She had a brother who was mentally retarded. He was bitter and jealous of her and Now doesn't talk to her. She knows all the right. I mean she in text intellectually. She's got all the right stuff, but I don't think she has all ever really don't listen to her feelings. She is in some way. She still does it with us, I think about when I'm old I kind of feel fortunate that my mother is so independent and that she doesn't rely on us for you know for a lot. I mean she knows, you know, she knows we love her and we need there in a second if she needed us we go down as often as we can but she has her own life there in California and it's not really part of hours and in some ways, you know, I feel lucky forgot and then in some ways I don't want to be like that with my kids now that I want them to feel like I'm a burden but I would want more of a closeness more exam in my life, especially as I get to you know, as I'm getting older. That's what you have left at this point in your family.\n",
            "Doctor: So, you know, you've named all these really traumatic things that your mother experience is quite a list. Do you feel that if she got in touch with those that she would be just too overwhelmed at what life has given her to force her to deal with and she simply say this is just too much.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, because that's basically what happened. She just couldn't handle life. She couldn't handle having kids. She couldn't handle it really was wasn't until she got involved volunteer worked just Dells into it. It just changed your life. I think she when she became president of the country County sorry and she was doing speeches all the time and she was you know, I think that she just kind of got lost. Herself and that became a different person. I think if she didn't I but she hadn't had that. I don't know what what happened to her.\n",
            "Doctor: This is a really bizarre analogy, but I was thinking about a muscle that gets under you said that it gets atrophies and then get so brittle it can break versus a muscle that keeps getting using fortified and strength and overtime.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And I was thinking that muscle being like exercising one's emotional. I don't know exactly emotional emotions or something like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: But that if it's if they're so underused it's like that's where the fragility comes from in a way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you worry that you don't have the strength to deal with all the feelings that you have?\n",
            "Patient: Not consciously in mind I mean not consciously but I'm sure I do. I mean I feel like I've dealt with a lot more at this point in my life. I've dealt with life and things and I'm sure I will be able to deal with whatever it is. It's just I don't know how to get there.\n",
            "Doctor: Maybe you got there a little today. I was thinking sometimes it's good to know the road you took to get to it. And if the goal is to get to a place maybe doesn't matter which road you took it does and it doesn't my guess.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: We're going to need to stop for today. Okay? I will see you next week.\n",
            "Patient: I'm not going to be here next week.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: I'm going to be out of work then combined with a fun thing. I'm going to Austin for it. I never been to Austin. My friend Gina is meeting me there because her daughter she not working right now her daughter lives in San Francisco and the plan was originally that she would come drive to San Francisco with me so he could so he could meet Melanie but does not off during weekend. So my daughter is coming out to Austin while we're there and then I'll have some free time with them. And then I'm working Thursday getting a car.\n",
            "Doctor: girlfriend\n",
            "Patient: I can see Melanie.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, sorry. Okay, so I will see you in 2 weeks then.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, great. Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi, come on in.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: Good morning.\n",
            "Patient: The last week this time, I think I was out of practice was part of it just like it has been a long time and I think we asked if I knew I was frustrated and I don't know what I said. If I answered that it's time that I had known that I was frustrated but not perhaps the extent to which I was not talking about being frustrated and that's hot difficulty talking about being frustrated with you. My friend Franko is applying for academic jobs right now, which is a stressful thing normally, but he's also the advice he got from his thesis committee was that he should just do another project real quick before he applied for jobs and use that as the top. So it gives him a month to do the work that normally would take a year or something which is terrible advice, but it's what he got. So I've been talking less about my frustrations with him so I can be available to him and not clearly not very good time in his life and not talking with Tony about it. There's kind of just a I think it did turn into a you know, it's like when I would come in here six months ago and I would be very angry or upset and not as aware of it or where the extent to which I was tamping it down keep going through. I think that's part of what was going on. It's a good thing that we had the sessions last week Tanya and I went to wedding of one of her cousins this weekend, which was a hard time for me. The wedding was beautiful and there were a lot of parties and that was all fine. Normal kind of annoyances that go along with going anywhere with her family. No one's ever on time for anything. We made it to the wedding on time by only by about 2 minutes and only because we tried to get there about 40 minutes early. So that was good. It's one of those things. I don't particularly care if we're always going to be late if we're not also trying to get there on time. So it's sort of like a I don't know the other failure to match one's own expectations is a particularly frustrating part for me anyways, so I just I started to say expectation that we've been an hour late and then it was so I can deal with that but that's that goes for talking about changing expectations in the face and not being able to trust that something will happen reset. The expectation is starting my response to it. You know, all the time is extended family. Wanted to know what a biomechanical engineer does. There was a nice guy Fisher out of frame it it's a reasonable question except for the panic and all of their eyes as they're asking question because I'm not going to understand what you're going to say Panic so I can't get a good response to that face with the these are minor things that just come with the territory there. Okay, we kind of got through them and move on it was the weekend was particularly hard, I guess in one General way and in one specific way the specific what way was that? It was very hard to stick to the same wedding ceremony the same letter G that I had gone through, you know, they say essentially the same. Was to each other and here I am sitting next to a person and having about sort of read to me as a People contract with the reality of my situation at present. These are the intentions or these are the promises and here's where we are.\n",
            "Doctor: Were there particular vows that were especially hard to hear?\n",
            "Patient: Doing the service they do this strange thing where they do exact location of intent and then they actually do the boughs and their separate parts of the ceremony presumably to ensure that the person get married isn't being forced to get married. That's why they have to declare their own in time. It's all historical kind of silly. And in that part. That's the part that contains the forsaking all others piece. So that's a little hard to hear. It's sort of like I was I guess I was in the process of dealing with that issue and then things got traumatically worse on the depression suicidality front. So it's hard to look back on my. And my marriage if any. Of my marriage say that was a really good time for longer than a few weeks. Pain in the actual Mouse portion. There's the in sickness and in health part, that's kind of a it sounds like a trap to me now. You know I made that I was fully aware Tanya's history of depression and amidst anxiety. That was her sort of default State during the wedding planning. But this where we are now is not really on the map when I did that so, you know, the whole thing kind of has a for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health sort of Duality contrasting to it. So it's hard to deal with when it feels vaguely like a bait and switch like yeah, there'll be both of these things. You'll have to deal with some bad things, but they're all be good things. Well, it's not been a whole lot of good things. So,\n",
            "Doctor: What are you thinking about?\n",
            "Patient: I was thinking about the other difficult part of it, which was the family and Tire in the entire scope of the weekend. I didn't put on his father and her sister both come to visit us in Andover, but I haven't really seen or really spoken with either of them in five or six months. So\n",
            "Doctor: It's been that long since we've been here.\n",
            "Patient: Maybe I miss estimating. So I guess Amanda was here in February. So that's been about 6 months. David was here maybe in March. So maybe April one of those two so four to six months. Yes, so it's been that long since they've been here. They've been in touch with Tanya talking to her which is good. But essentially not communicating with me at all, which I wouldn't say. I thought about a whole lot but I'm seeing them again. It's sort of like, yeah, I guess things have been hard here. And where have you all been and we're not going to even talk about it being having been hard or anything the entire time that we're here. I just, you know, there's a sort of mutual and knowledge meant that it has been a long time since you see each other and it's good to see you and I think that was real that's about it. So And so I think I feel more alone in this and angry about that. Not that they're particularly people that I would rely on that. They were the were the people that were involved in this in at least vaguely in a crisis situation. So it's\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel like they just you're not on their radar they don't get it or do you feel like there's sort of actively trying to avoid something?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know. I don't know. So I guess we're some of us are leaving the reception the wedding reception at 2 in the morning. They're still whole lot of dancing and drinking and partying going on, but it's time for some of us myself included. But Amanda it's on your sister is still there. And so in that that was the only moment in which we had anything like a conversation about it, and in that moment. She wanted to tell me that I wanted to leave didn't really want to be having a conversation at that moment. This was like bye I'll see you tomorrow for the conversation on my part, but on her part, it was so glad to see you. I've been thinking about you everyday. I know we haven't talked, but I've been thinking about you. To which I sort of I said, well your life hasn't been exactly great either. She's been fired from her job for failure to be organized at all. Wish you responded. Yeah, but something to the extent that's not an excuse. So no, I don't think I'm not on their radar. I think that I think in her case, she feels like she ought to do something but isn't quite clear what it is and that has set up some sort of guilt cycle that prevents her from speaking to me except when she's really drunk. It's not like I'm thinking about the whole thing. If this were a weekend where they were all coming because no one's life is in a particularly wonderful place right now and everyone is like let's just leave everything behind have a really good time and focus on these people who are getting married I can get behind on something. A that's not why what they were doing because it's not like they're normally dealing with their issues. So it's not like leaving them behind as a change and be David's approach to the weekend was try to mend fences with all the siblings were not someone's always fighting with his siblings. There are like six of them, so too. so it's so that no sense was at the approach. So it's I don't know. I guess I've lost the thread I can sort of rationalize what's going on, but I'm still upset about it. Which I find a little strange in that watching myself perspective because I don't really go there with any exception expectation of actually didn't go there with any expectations at all. So I in some part of me. It's like what are you upset about butt?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it sounds like you didn't go with me explicit expectations.\n",
            "Patient: Fair enough. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You are deeply unhappy and deeply angry about your situation.\n",
            "Patient: Sure seem to be yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, sure seems that way to me.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I'm sitting here trying to sort out like why why am I so unhappy and angry about this? And it seems like the more I try to recapture the sense of self the more I'm like what the hell was all of this and then you know, I think you've noticed that I value personal responsibility and we talked about to what extent is hog assault we're not on his fault. And so the farther we get from it, but I guess the more of a claim of lack of control or whatever seems like a convenient excuse or something.\n",
            "Doctor: on her part\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I wonder where you going to say something.\n",
            "Patient: I'm very curious about what you wonder I was just going to say it's also I mean, I can't really even talked about it with her because she doesn't remember it. So it's like how can I hold her accountable for something she I'm in a position of power in a sense if I can say this happened or you were this way and how could she were but or comment so it's like I can't even I don't know address or something.\n",
            "Doctor: And that confuse me for the moment because it sounds like at least some important features of her you feel are still there. So when you said you can't address it because it was in the past. I\n",
            "Patient: No, she doesn't remember it it is it was erased from her memory by the ECT Sochi.\n",
            "Doctor: yeah.\n",
            "Patient: So like the particularly bad. Of Our Lives she has essentially no. No memories from what were you wondering?\n",
            "Doctor: It's interesting because it was sort of related to that. There's one piece of dealing with Tanya's illness in the present and then also in the past which is sort of a traumatic event for lack of a better term that you went through that you feel completely alone in and you can't share with her because she was there and not there at the same time or yeah, I guess that's one way of putting it but when you were talking just a moment ago and in terms of control and responsibility, I was thinking that I sounded like to meet one of the conflicts that you're experiencing is being married to someone who you were worried as a sort of fundamentally different personal and moral ethics than you which is not about the ACT.\n",
            "Patient: I know that's right.\n",
            "Doctor: It's not even about her illness.\n",
            "Patient: I know that's right. That's right. It's sort of like through the land of illness I have.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and that is yeah. I know I think that's a really nice inside. I was not that. But it there might head wants two days ago and I haven't looked at it since anything that visiting her family and being frustrated by like everyone in her family, like extended family included being having a particular sense of ethic is or proselyte just romantically different from mine. Yeah. I think that's a large piece of them. Yeah, and I have no idea what to do about that. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, this is certainly not the only solution or it's not the whole solution. But this kind of thing. I think you can have conversations with Tanya about.\n",
            "Patient: I think that's right. Yeah, I guess I'm thinking about two things one. I'm not exactly sure how to have those conversations. It's kind of a practical issue that can be dealt with the other is that I think this is I think it helps explain why hey I have been not quite sure how to phrase it but less than perfectly pleased by her wanting to take on some of her responsibilities again, there's this element of not trusting that that's a good idea and it sends the shell overburden herself, but I think this is also like a I don't know a sense of assuming responsibilities when it's convenient as opposed to always or something and so it's now it's convenient again. So you want to take them back will great. That's not that's not how we do things. I think that's I think that's right. So in a practical sense, I'm not sure how to have the conversation because clearly I'm pretty frustrated or upset non one level. It's not particularly time to start into a conversation that We're at a whole lot of pent-up frustration and on the other hand. It's not particularly clear that she can handle a conversation where I'm very frustrated. I think she probably can but\n",
            "Doctor: and handle meaning\n",
            "Patient: Not going to spiral the ends up in the very bad place again, you know when suicidality or self-injury are Hospital.\n",
            "Doctor: I can't answer that on a practical level. But it seems like ultimately an untenable way to live your life. On a very basic level you can't control for all the factors that will upset her and I appreciate your saying well these speaking is upsetting her so I can choose not to speak which is different than other things which seem more out of your control. But I think it's a general approach in your marriage. It's untenable on it. So many levels not the least of which is the pent-up anger will just continue to grow.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right. Yeah, I hear you when I think you're right. I just don't ya I don't have a particularly clear view of what a tenable strategy is at this point.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, when one feels really really angry at the person or people they love being worried about the impact of that anger. I think it's a general fear. I mean, I think that's kind of a sphere in general that you might have regardless of onions psychological state.\n",
            "Patient: Sure.\n",
            "Doctor: And then it's exacerbated by it.\n",
            "Patient: So what do people do?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, they can do one of two things they can keep inside or they can express it. Or maybe the question was more complicated than that. Probably it was because that's what about bs. What are you thinking?\n",
            "Patient: I'm thinking that in order to express it to her. I have to find the right level of not caring about the impact on her. I mean I cannot be worried about the impact and say something but in order not to be worried about the impact of has to at some point not care about what it does her because if I know it's going to happen and they do it. Anyway, then I've done this thing.\n",
            "Doctor: But you can't know.\n",
            "Patient: No, I can't. No, but if I can reasonably project that it's going to do something bad. And I do it like I'm not going to throw a rock at your head because I can't know what's going to happen, but it's probably going to hurt.\n",
            "Doctor: That's so much as a scientist. That's that's a terrible analogy. You can project was far more accuracy than the other by. So that's what's wrong with the argument because you can't know you can have a fantasy that you can know. I understand your prediction is not 50/50 random. Yes, but you still can't know but you certainly feel that your anger can be destructive.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's definitely true. Yeah, I guess I'm still stuck on Canton. Oh, yeah, I definitely feel that my anger can be destructive. I guess I told you before that I have sometimes when I'm very angry. I want to smash everything. I don't that's a control thing. I don't do it not I don't want to do it. So yeah, I feel like I could easily be obstructed if I were to let it sit so that's certainly a component here or it feels like it but I am I guess I'm yeah, I guess I'm stuck on can't know it's not that I don't accept like yeah, obviously I can't know there's not a but it feel like you're making us stronger saying that like I cannot project with any reasonable certainty that like, yeah, it's not 50/50, but I can't tilt it much past 5545 or something.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, then maybe I'm not giving you enough credit so far as not knowing what you feel she can and can't handle.\n",
            "Patient: No, I you know, you're probably right I just Can't I don't know. It's a I mean, I know I think you're right. I do not have a particularly good sense of this moment of what she can and can't handle because at any given time I sense of what she can and can't handle seems like behind where she actually is. It was accurate two weeks ago or whatever, but it's not accurate for the day.\n",
            "Doctor: Well James, we're actually going.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: That we're going to need to end on that note. I was going to say or I'm going to say, you know, I'm happy to meet with you if you wanted to do twice a week for a while. We can really just get into it and we are into it. You've got a lot to figure out there sometime constraint sounds like in terms of your job and figuring that out. So I just want to put that out there to you that I'd be happy to do it. I think it'd be helpful not to say that meeting once a week isn't helpful.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'm not sure I can. Think about it.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: And I'll be in touch. Thanks.\n",
            "Doctor: I'll see you next week then. Okay, you take care.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, they're doing some painting probably the next time it'll be the new furniture.\n",
            "Patient: Oh wow.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, so painting furniture and rugs\n",
            "Patient: So I defended my dissertation.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, congratulations.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: How did it go?\n",
            "Patient: It went fine. It was not the best presentation I've ever given but it was good enough. So I got the dissertation done early Friday morning food, Ohio and Sunday made my slides and I finish those Tuesday morning and then give the fuck an hour later. So not the way I would recommend doing it to anyone, but it got done.\n",
            "Doctor: That's a milestone.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, it's a big milestone. Yeah, we talked some last week about why it was it. Why didn't finish it on Tuesday when it was do we talked about trusting the system and kind of other things like that. I think there's pieces of that involved that I think one important piece is that I was trying to do something that was at the edges of what was possible in terms of like 2 weeks before that. I had nothing for my dissertation and my paper separately. So I simply put everything into the dissertation and ruin half of it entirely in the two-week period or two and a half way. Because it took me a little longer so I wouldn't really recommend that either but that was what I did and I feel like there's an important question and why did I do that there and some of that is related to the deadline so forth but part of his I have a difficult time estimating how long something is going to take sometimes I do things like this where that should not have been possible but I did it that makes it harder to ask me the next time. How long is that task going to actually take I have no idea how long that has should have taken out. All I can say is that it took a whole lot of work and I didn't not so there's a piece there's also I didn't want to reschedule it. I didn't want to because that's a little less clear why I really really didn't want to reschedule. It. It was like there's a household rescheduling to get all the right people in the same room at the same time. Most of it I think was I think I felt like rescheduling it would be admitting defeat us on Despite the not really. Not really being true in any meaningful sense and I felt like my circle of close friends has had a lot of negative incidents in the last year. You know, Tanya has been hospitalized multiple times and left her program Frank almost died almost to apply for faculty job and then had to not because it was driving him crazy. I felt like in substance the people around me needed success and I needed a success for me. And so I thought you might find that interesting. So I shared that with you, but you don't have to find that interesting. That's okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, I was going to say you thought it was important you're thinking it's important to talk about it is different than my finding it interesting. I mean there's a relationship but\n",
            "Patient: I feel like there's probably some overlap in the tropics but maybe not\n",
            "Doctor: well one is about me and the other would be more about you and what you need.\n",
            "Patient: in one of the ways those two things overlap is that you suggested you were trying to help me figure out what I need is so I feel like that description at least Bears on that whether or not it actually is about whether I need to talk about it I feel like what I just said describe some piece of me in a way that might be helpful in that task for you that might've sidestepped entirely what you were trying to get up\n",
            "Doctor: No, the other thoughts are related because one of it is about me figuring out what's important and the other is your feeling that something is important.\n",
            "Patient: Rights that felt like an important thing to say here. Other than that. I'm not really sure and there's a sense in which like me recognizing us is going on is important but then I don't really need to tell you but I feel like it's more helpful. They do tell you when I notice things like that or feel like that's how things are going in an information-gathering sense. I think but I'm not sure.\n",
            "Doctor: Is it a matter of how much of your experience do you feel should be private or not?\n",
            "Patient: That's really interesting. I don't know. I tend to feel like less of my experience should be private here than I often maintain elsewhere. But I hadn't really thought of it in terms of privacy. You're looking at me very intently.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I'm just trying to pursue it out. It seems like a lots coming up so far in the session. So I'm just trying to sort of parse it out.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, you're allowed to look at me intently. I don't mind.\n",
            "Doctor: But it's noticeable.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay.\n",
            "Patient: So the following week has been a little bit strange. So yeah a whole lot of people have been excited for me and congratulatory and all of that it took me most of Wednesday to fly back most of Wednesday to fly back last week because when I booked the flights, I was a lot of traffic I had sort of thought that I would be very pleased afterwards and certainly after I finish the dissertation and sent it off. I had very Lake intensely peaceful feeling that was really nice. It lasted about 10 hours. So I slept for four of those and then after about six hours of being awake, I felt like I really had to start making travel plans for how is getting in to Ohio. And then what size was I going to prevent the most after I defended I felt tired because I haven't slept very much last couple of days. So on Wednesday, I was more rested and also I felt something closer to like I guess there were kind of two separate things one was like lost purpose. It's like it's been a very intense and focused experience and clarifying in some way. That's nice. And so there was sort of some sense of loss and not going away. It's so clear. What I need to do next but there's no urgency to it. Even if the urgency was entirely artificial and mostly self-imposed. The other thing was sort of like a dread of coming back. Even when Tanya as well these days she's still very depressed and that's hard to be around all the time. It just is a it's a hard thing. So, you know, I might say something like I don't want to live that way for the rest of my life. But I also recognize that I do have a tendency to despair about some situations and I'm trying to find a realistic balance between this black between the wings that was sort of the end of that little spot.\n",
            "Doctor: Right in that way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And when you stay this way for the rest of my life, can you be more kind of flush that out of it?\n",
            "Patient: Sure, as long as depression drugs on four more years, it feels like more like it's a drain on me emotionally and TimeWise and there is there's not much else in a relationship for me besides that that's a particularly Bleak picture of it if not totally accurate, but it's like the most important feature of a relationship is not doing things together caring about each other taking care of each other in like normal way. It's serviced her depression or something.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel that in addition to their not being more than Tanya's depression in your marriage you feel that's true for Tanya as a person to that that much of her life right now.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, I feel like she has worked hard in the last I don't know 8 months to make that less true, but something can be less true and still very true. So. One thing I haven't really said anything about anyone else but in the last week a number of people particularly her friends, but a number of people have started like been congratulatory and said things like I'm so happy for both of you think I got it while in general since I sort of appreciate the sentiment. I think I find it irritating because I don't feel like this is a thing we did. This is the thing that I did in spite of circumstances some of which were Tanya, so I mostly wanted to say that so now I have and that's better. Thank you.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel trapped in any way?\n",
            "Patient: Absolutely ya know but I think we've talked about that sound before I felt trapped in a lot of ways and one of the things that I do when I feel trapped is I try to find a way to like get out of it. So one of the things back on out of this by finishing my dissertation, so I feel West Rockton on my boys are still paying me and I'm still doing like some revisions and writing up papers, but I'm not trapped in that relationship that's in this weird place where I'm halfway across the country by video conference when I'm biomechanics should be in a laboratory like so that's gone if that makes sense. And so that has dramatically Less in my feeling of being at least for now.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you know we talked about this a little bit before but do you know what you'd like to do next?\n",
            "Patient: Not tonight in ideal since I don't know what the ideal thing would be to do. But I also know that I want to eat and I would like to do by mechanics, I think so, I think that I will apply for a postdoc with a couple of people that seems like I'll be relatively happy to work with there are a few other people. I can apply for a postdoc with but I don't think I will.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you and Tanya talk about this?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Yeah mostly in the context of where who it would be. I think I told you that I fix that chapter of my dissertation that was falling apart. Did I mention that? Okay. So that's that parts now, perhaps my favorite section of the dissertation both because I fix it and because it's so my advisor Kevin really likes chemistry the change the way he thinks about the world and somewhere and so the answer to that puzzle which he had in front of him for five or six years now is relatively simple but it requires considering an element that normally we don't consider or piece that we normally don't consider and so there's a sense in which that has changed the way he thinks about the electron structure of these compounds and that's so it's nice because it's like one of my one of the things that I really hope that I could do is do chemistry that he would find like in that class of things that really change the way you think about something and so, you know, I guess I'm proud of having done that in so that changed my general feelings about getting it. I put me in a place where I feel less like put me in a place where I feel more like it would be a very reasonable choice for someone to hire me. So I feel Trapped in that regard also and that sort of unrelated to the question. You just asked kind of in the same thing.\n",
            "Doctor: What would make you feel less trapped in your marriage with Tanya?\n",
            "Patient: That is a fantastic question. I don't know how to answer it. I mean, I think it's really the right question in some way but I don't even know how to begin tackling it. My first response is to say well, why do I feel trapped because if I can identify that then in theory I could alleviate some of those things and I think we just talked about that in some sense. She's unhappy most of the time and not And I guess I feel like I don't really trust her to or the same extent at all. Like I just I meant to say more there but then. Seems like the appropriate place for it.\n",
            "Doctor: But that's not what mately what makes you feel trapped because you're trapped by your sense of obligation.\n",
            "Patient: Right, right.\n",
            "Doctor: I mean if it was going on if Tanya didn't have the problems she's having the question wouldn't even come up and so you would feel trapped but given that this is a situation.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so I feel trapped I think because I can't leave or I can't leave without breaking about which is the thing. I don't want to do and I can't make her better and it's I don't know. I'm not sure how to say it. Other than like it's emotionally draining to be in a relationship with someone who's like who's depressed.\n",
            "Doctor: And the training part is it that you get little of what you need or is it that being around that sort of mood or atmosphere brings you down?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I think those are related things. Yeah, I think it's not strictly fair to say I get little of what I need. I think maybe it's better to say I cannot predict when I will get anything that I need or when it will be like no having needs a totally unacceptable or intolerable or something. So that does one thing and then like feeling like it's a burden to ask for anything is another thing. Yeah, if I don't just as myself from her at least internally then yeah it is it is doesn't hack my mood for her mood to be low, but then if I distance from her internally, then we're just in some sense and that itself is like not necessarily what I want in a relationship and I'm not saying like I wanted was to be tightly coupled at all times but like is not a feature of relationships like shared experience or something like that. That was actually meant to be a question.\n",
            "Doctor: Really?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, what's so that means there's more than one answer to the question. So what are the different answers?\n",
            "Patient: Yes or no, or that's not the right way to think about it or something.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, it's something that you want in a relationship. So it seems like that's a good.\n",
            "Patient: Right, but I feel like sometimes we want things in relationships that we should not want or that like that reflects a problem in itself.\n",
            "Doctor: and you feel like that's part of the concern that some of the things that you might be looking for aren't sort of realistic or\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I understand element of that. But that more rises from like not having a clear sense of what does a kid need or want or something like that? And I was like intrinsic question me or someone sort of like well, it seems like I can't have these things. Is it even okay to want them or something like that away in which is draining is I like to be around people who are excited about something, you know about particularly about what they're doing or what they're reading or thinking about or something. It's just but\n",
            "Doctor: And you felt like that's not present in Tanya.\n",
            "Patient: Not very often anymore.\n",
            "Doctor: Does she have future plans for herself?\n",
            "Patient: So she talking about wanting to be a priest and so she's a little bit excited about that and a little bit terrified about that and knows our I understand both of those and that's fine. I feel like wanting to be a priest is mostly a response to feeling like she can't be a cat. Academic academic session and feeling that's the closest thing given the type of schooling that she's done.\n",
            "Doctor: I have a couple of different kinds of thoughts. My first thought was getting back to something that you said early in the session where you said I thought this would be interesting to you and I was thinking about 15 till 2 orientation. It is toward another person in this case me. And not about I really want to talk about this sort of like almost and I understand there is they're not completely untied but it's not about you and what you want and what you need in your session and what you're going to talk about today.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's interesting.\n",
            "Doctor: It's like you being here for me rather than meeting here for you.\n",
            "Patient: I certainly don't think of the session that way so\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I understand that. I certainly don't experience the totality of our sessions like that. But there's something in you that feels that way and I am actually related to Tanya and I can get you a lot of things.\n",
            "Patient: yeah, I mean, I don't know whether it's related to Tanya or whether they're like both related to the same thing. I think it's more like that.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, right. Yeah, right. I meant it that way.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I guess you probably did mean that yeah, so that's kind of a big probably a d feature of highlight to existing relationships. I don't want the relationship to all be about me. And so it's we talked many times about this being a strange relationship for me because like I come and tell you my problems and that's what we talked about. So, yeah, I definitely feel like I also try to alter that narrative at least internally somewhat in order to feel better about it or something, but also in the real world like actually want to talk about things that are interesting to you. Maybe I want to be interesting to you wishes.\n",
            "Doctor: That's what I thought. I'm sorry. What were you?\n",
            "Patient: I didn't have a follow-up that or I thought that there was more but that was\n",
            "Doctor: Well the thought I had which certainly you know can relate to Tanya. Although not necessarily produced by the situation is like sort of what makes people want other people to stick around. The idea of your saying things that interest me is maybe a way I would want you to stay around.\n",
            "Patient: seems reasonable Yeah. Most complicated. I assume you don't have anyone that comes in here and tries to alienate you like if they're so above they're going to throne on I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: People who try to alienate people in their life in general for complicated motivations will probably come and try to alienate me, too.\n",
            "Patient: fair enough\n",
            "Doctor: It's probably hard for you to imagine\n",
            "Patient: I mean, I guess I have had experience of people who seem like they're trying to alienate everyone around them. That's a mindset that I have a really hard time like grabbing.\n",
            "Doctor: I would imagine. But you were that was en route to your saying something else.\n",
            "Patient: Well, so that yeah, that was mostly just saying like that seems like one lemon the end of it. I wouldn't expect anyone to come in and do that. Although obviously people do so, but insane obviously people do I think that are actually resolve some of what I was trying to resolve because\n",
            "Doctor: well\n",
            "Patient: go ahead now, go ahead.\n",
            "Doctor: Well, there's a right. So there's the Counterpoint to wanted to interest me, which is alienate me, but then there's also the it's just not a it's not a concern so it doesn't come up.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, there is that like don't care about you as a person.\n",
            "Doctor: No, it's that. It's not a concern. It's felt like to be a given. So that it wouldn't be something that you would need to sort of have on your mind and work towards.\n",
            "Patient: I see.\n",
            "Doctor: It would be a given.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that's not a given.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah. And then the question is which I think. Which is I think a big question, but you know, why not?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so that's one of those like really deep questions that I have a hard time grabbing because it's sort of like well, how is that even a question? Do you walk into a room expect everyone to be interested in you and what you have to say?\n",
            "Doctor: This week. I'm realizing we need to stop and we definitely have to come back to this. I think it's because it's so important.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: So the next few Wednesdays are holidays.\n",
            "Patient: right\n",
            "Doctor: Are you awake for I'm here. So I'm happy to reschedule if you were here or else.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, so I'm not here next Wednesday.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: But the following Wednesday is January 1st.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, so I'm not.\n",
            "Patient: I will be here but I assume you are not working on January 1st.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, so I'm not here on those Wednesdays, but I am here the other days.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: So I'm happy to reschedule.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so I guess I could do any other time in that first week of January. I can't do next week. Well, I think we're getting back. What are Tuesday?\n",
            "Doctor: I have time on Thursday the 2nd.\n",
            "Patient: That would be great.\n",
            "Doctor: But see I have a I could do 12:45 you want to do that?\n",
            "Patient: That's fine. Sure.\n",
            "Doctor: So, let's see do not next week and then the following week rather than the first I'll see you on the 2nd at 12:45.\n",
            "Patient: That sounds great.\n",
            "Doctor: And then we'll go back to Wednesdays.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, great. Okay. Take care. Have a good Christmas. Okay.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you. You too.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay. Take care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: Hi.\n",
            "Patient: Hi. Ran into he's real nice.\n",
            "Doctor: Good. I will be meeting with him like very occasionally every 4 or 5 weeks or so at this time.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: at the same time\n",
            "Patient: It doesn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: it doesn't matter.\n",
            "Patient: It really doesn't.\n",
            "Doctor: All right.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, well, I guess it matters a little bit like he sort of makes me cry, but it doesn't I don't care. I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm going with it matters.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I really wish it didn't matter.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he's a really great person. Yeah, I don't know. I really really wish it didn't.\n",
            "Doctor: Seeing him. as though it an indication of your like not being together somehow or not being able to handle yourself or\n",
            "Patient: Or yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: like not being able to get a piece of work done that you wanted to do or something like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, sort of. Yeah, I sort of just feel like a mess. I mean their stuff to do with hardware and that comes up all the time. So it's not like I feel like I'm constantly have school stuff coming up. I hate that.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel a little more like you can sort of both acknowledge that and heated and not necessarily look like a fuck up in the process?\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: You seem very frustrated.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I'm sorry. I am yeah, I don't. Kind of like know what to talk about. Talk about everything. care\n",
            "Doctor: What do you mean?\n",
            "Patient: I just I guess. the you know, I want to talk about sorry, I guess. I find myself. I just never mind. Sorry. I guess it's okay for me to talk about this.\n",
            "Doctor: It is something you have to go through.\n",
            "Patient: just thinking about the way this all gets put in put into place.\n",
            "Doctor: The way what gets put into place. I'm aware that you're struggling with things.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I I'm sorry.\n",
            "Doctor: Like you can't put the words together.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: The impression that I get and maybe this is not what it's like is sort of like being in one of those states where you kind of are kind of half asleep or drifting off to sleep and something wakes you up and you have all the stuff that was like right there on your mind. You can't quite fit it or put into words or you wake up from it dreaming even though you were wishing. I was kind of gone and it feels like it's very present.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, that feels about right.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You seem to shake your head at first, but that does seem kind of what it is like.\n",
            "Patient: Yes.\n",
            "Doctor: And you seem to be left with does the dream Seymour, right? You have you seem to have liked some of that evident and like feelings and reactions from the dream, even though you don't kind of remember it like you look upset and you look frustrated. I think you're trying to say something about how you feel the way with the prior, you know, thinking some thoughts about that.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: You also do seem like increasingly connected you seem closer to being able to say something sort of that you've been.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I feel that way.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes.\n",
            "Patient: But still I'm just not there.\n",
            "Doctor: I know it seems like you're not quite there.\n",
            "Patient: That's what's striking.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: I just feel like I'm never quite there.\n",
            "Doctor: Never quite able to do the thing that you really need to do.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I think so the question that then goes through my mind as well. And so what's the big deal and I think that the biggest deal about it is you're feeling that you always have to be able to do for yourself.\n",
            "Patient: How do you make?\n",
            "Doctor: Thank something just now or working at Starbucks or showing the apartment or getting school work done. I think you hold on one of the things that really keeps you together. Is that feeling of being able to sort of do for yourself? Whatever it is that you need to do that you need to do. That's when that's gone. The bottom drops out.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: Here, I think the way of being played out is if you can't say something if you can't do for yourself that way I can't help you. I think that's probably part of it. I can't help you and it's your fault.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think that sounds like it.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes. There may be another part of you might feel also a very fond wish to be put it like I'm not sure about this, but I wonder if you feel like a kind of countervailing. Wish to not be able to do anything and be taken care of or helped in any way. I wonder I don't know about this, but I wonder if there's a part of you that and if it's true, I think this is a part of yourself. You probably hate. Vigorously, but sort of is probing or testing. Well, what if I can talk, you know kind of still get help.\n",
            "Patient: I don't know.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean. Seems like a real unclear don't they?\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah at the place where I can kind of see that kind of like go for like popping his head up most visibly is in the release you can feel being in the hospital.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: You know where there's some you know, that part feels like okay here. I don't have to do anything. Like I can just you know be taken care of and who is really going to run with that. I would say let the booze going to suck and there's just no two ways about that. But you tend to be pretty critical of the hospital in some ways. I personally have to agree with a lot of things you're critical about. You know, some of the kinds of care they don't provide and get to know you and the stay so short, you know, like I think I get it, you know, and I agree, but I wonder if there's something else going on there as well, which is that you're sort of your directing out were some of the fiery do you have for Giselle for wanting to be there? You know kind of like well, I'm not really getting taken care of here and I want to be clear about that and I'm like having mental and like having been totally right about them because I couldn't take it if I was bragging on myself actually wanted to be here and feeling released.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Again, I'm not saying that maybe when it's less true things get a little tricky with you. It's like if it was me, I agree with a lot of things you but that doesn't necessarily sort of me.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. No, I think I agree with you there. I don't know what to do about it.\n",
            "Doctor: So very effective. Maybe there's like a off and we'll say well I don't know what to do about it, which maybe is again like we didn't was sort of competence and activity in the sense of having to do for yourself. If I just said something. I think it's difficult for you. Your first thought is okay. Well I should do something really about this.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And I guess what I'm saying is I think that's I think I said something with you that it probably are kind of disturbing and your go-to is like, okay. Well, I guess I should do something. You know, I'm not sure what to do OSHA like is that\n",
            "Patient: Yes, yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Otherwise, you're laughing a kind of more helpless more dependent.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Much more scary.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: vision we're going to stop in a couple minutes. I just want to check in about like cutting since\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I haven't been cutting. I'm not sure that I'm feeling at my low space but often so it's fine.\n",
            "Doctor: have you wanted to\n",
            "Patient: Yeah. Yeah, but I haven't I've been with James so I think okay.\n",
            "Doctor: probably James has kept you from it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think so.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, you've been thinking about suicide.\n",
            "Patient: I haven't been thinking much about suicide but I\n",
            "Doctor: So you're referring to more cutting yourself or?\n",
            "Patient: yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: That makes sense. I'm just\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: trying to because you haven't been thinking about suicide lately.\n",
            "Patient: Not as much.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: But yeah. Yeah, and yeah, I'm okay.\n",
            "Doctor: anything else\n",
            "Patient: I don't think so. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctor: I got your message about the\n",
            "Patient: yeah, it was kind of like it was going to be just the way just way too complicated and expensive and you might have to take like state exam and it doesn't seem like a good idea every state requires that you pee pee and then\n",
            "Doctor: probably yeah.\n",
            "Patient: but like the one that everybody takes\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I think I must have taken that one.\n",
            "Patient: like most of them required some sort of State exam and then they all require like pretty high application fee and it yeah in like I yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: All right. Well, I'll if they require like\n",
            "Patient: They all require like the degree and then 1500 hours of time.\n",
            "Doctor: right\n",
            "Patient: Supervise, which seemed to be about the same everywhere.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, I guess I wondered in the sense of transfers. I took the Epp. I got a million hours experience. I don't know whether I would have to do it in their state. That would be a problem if I could count whatever was done or what I had done in University. That's not a big deal.\n",
            "Patient: Okay.\n",
            "Doctor: and by a huge fee\n",
            "Patient: So it's like somewhere between 3 and $600.\n",
            "Doctor: All right.\n",
            "Patient: Which seemed a lot to me?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, let me look really pretty easy to find out where the information was.\n",
            "Patient: Four everywhere except Virginia shockingly enough. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Well again, it's possible that some of that stuff might be more feasible.\n",
            "Patient: Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, me too. Thank you for doing that.\n",
            "Doctor: Sure.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, and it was because it seems like three came back a little early early yesterday. He said it did pass the budget and was like, okay. I'm never going to do anything for a while.\n",
            "Doctor: Good.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I don't have to yeah, although it's you know, my sister-in-law. I don't think we're ever going to be kindred spirits. I've grown to really love and appreciate them. And also they're just a divided like I don't know. We just don't have we don't think anything else anything alike? Yeah. Which is higher do you know, especially like the older sister Vivian is we actually do have a lot of the same interest in common which is really feel really sad whenever we talk about them. She was an English teacher also and like loves literature but doesn't love any of the same literature that I do in like Yeah from my perspective doesn't think about it terribly analytically and I feel guilty for thinking that way but we like talk about the and Jessica. Will not stop giving me advice which I don't it drives me nuts, you know in some ways like she's probably should give me advice at this point advice about the kids. You know, she's got a two year old who is hilarious? Putting her stuff draft in timeout and why are you putting Gigi in timeout? Because she said bitch. Do we say bitch know we don't that's Mommy. That's mommy and daddy's word. Yeah, which is I think a pretty good way to deal with swearing and kids, you know, like that's just not your word. James and I had a pretty big fight in the other the other night, which was good. I it helped us talk more about not being where we wanted to be together. You know, I think to be someone who I can talk to anymore, which that's a bad thing. So.\n",
            "Doctor: What do you mean?\n",
            "Patient: So from James's perspective, I think it's like he doesn't really talk to me about his work anymore. He hasn't been talking to me about this, you know the process of figuring out what to do next very much. I think you know, I think there was a long time where I just really wasn't able to have a conversation. That's what it feels like to him. I think he's worried about that. He's been very in the habit of not bothering me with the logistics or not asking me to help deal with the logistics. It's you know, or that it will be too much for me for me. I feel like I can't tell whether I'm more sensitive than usual or whether James is more dismissive than usual. I feel like when. I also can't tell whether it's just like I need to be right more than usual or he's being were the mint than usual and telling that I'm wrong all the time, but it's just like I feel like when I try to talk to him about things and that I worried about like I feel like my feelings end up getting hurt a lot. Yeah. Yeah, I guess the summation of our fight would be James day. And you know, I'm so angry at you because you left me and I'm really glad that you didn't kill yourself, but that's a pretty tough minimums day. Like it's not a great minimum and me saying, you know, I feel like I deserve a medal for not killing myself. So I'm feeling pretty good about that. Yeah. I'm so worried about the point where I'm thinking. Well, okay, if he's going to continue to get angry about get angry about me in about this I need you know he needs to look for ways I could make it better but I feel like I'm just doing everything that I can to make things better I'm not I mean I'm not everything yet not everything I can but everything I can think of and can handle you know it's like he's been very clear we've both been very clear that the way that I can take care of us as a couple right now is to take care of myself and that's what I'm doing and I don't know what to do I want to be enough some suggestions as to what to do next I don't think he's glad to be married to me at this point. And I don't know how to say how to handle that certainly thinking and sort of cautiously saying we need to get back into marriage counseling and I'm like no. No this really needs to happen. Like I need to make this happen.\n",
            "Doctor: I could find you guys a is he still seeing Smith?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, he is.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, she's just more in that Community than I am.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: So she would probably be she could probably think of names at the top of her head.\n",
            "Patient: awesome\n",
            "Doctor: If you get stuck, let me know when I can.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I think James gets along very well with her. I think it would make him feel more comfortable to.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah.\n",
            "Patient: You know, like I'm angry at him for it's hard to hold on to being angry. I'm having a hard time talking to you about this, which actually talk to you about it. Yeah, I feel like I don't want to tell tell you about James disappoint James his disappointment anger with me because you might catch it.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: Or you might take my side over his and that that might be almost as bad. We had a conversation earlier that day about kind of cost and I was thinking that sounds like someone had roof for like there that people thought that like the hypomania coming from bipolar II thought it was a real gift and they're like, oh, haha. That's really sad. I'm like, I don't know. I think it might actually be a pastoral gift.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sorry. I'm a little.\n",
            "Patient: oh, this is like from this is kind of kind of the setup for this conversation.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, somebody was talking about hypomania is the Pastoral gift.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, or they were saying that they did not think that it was a gift or they were like, no, it's just bad and I was kind of like well, I don't know for like her romantic. The time are a time of like intense work and where she does really good work. I don't think it's worth the price. I think she should get the treatment for it. Like I don't know that doesn't mean you can't use the things that come with these horrible things that happened to you.\n",
            "Doctor: I see.\n",
            "Patient: James and I kind of talked around that for a while and around like the idea that you know, you end up paying pretty much every gift in some way or another that's how the world Works in. So then like that conversation have been done like at the end of the night it was it was very late. And I you know made some reference to my being she was like well every guess if every gift comes with a price and it really really hurt my feelings a lot. I'm not sure why I should like You know, his attitude was I'm not going to tell you that things are good when? They are good. My attitude was I don't want you to I just don't want you to tell me that things are bad at midnight when I'm about to go to bed, and I've had a good day.\n",
            "Doctor: Yeah, I guess the thing that I'm sort of thinking is your surprise to his comment hurt or you're saying you're not clear why it hurt a lot.\n",
            "Patient: I know it's been I know it's been hard being married to me. I really know that like I would see that maybe I say that I'm surprised or say that I don't know why it hurts because I don't think it ought ought to I don't think I should let myself get hurt by it. It does feel.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you feel that? I did catch a little James's sort of quality there and asking you a question like that like I'm saying. Well. I mean not as As I was telling you that telling you you weren't perceptive left or not reacting correctly or something like that.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I felt like not reacting correctly or not interpreting correctly. I feel like or I feel like I should be okay with having.\n",
            "Doctor: If you know in your head that you still a mix about being married to you or because of your depression that if you know those things that is bringing them up shouldn't hurt or something like that something like that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I mean, I know he's not glad to be married to me because I asked him. Which I feel like my beware. The the communication between us is always upset with him for answering the question. I'm already upset with him for answering the question.\n",
            "Doctor: I'm sorry, so you muddy the waters because he thought you were upset because he answered the question in the way. He answered it upset you.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And you're saying you're upset by asking it.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, but like I asked him it because because of what he had said.\n",
            "Doctor: Oh, I see falling that you ask him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, I didn't get that.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: And your worry is that hearing this exchange between the two of you? I will either like catch contagious some of his particular attitude towards you in this way and I feel I will feel that about you as well or that I will take your side and say like I can't believe you said that\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, something like that.\n",
            "Doctor: Something like that. And either one. I think if I were to do either one of those things, I think I would start to be like reacting for you a little bit to the situation with him rather than like let you talk about it.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, it's taking me a long time to process things. I didn't know. I think it's I think that it's a little different I think so. Yeah, I think that I'm worrying that you will agree with him in that, you know being angry and be disappointed with me about the depression that would that would just be hard like I think that they're different coming from different places like it's I Yeah, I think one one hand. I I very much want to take care of James. So maybe I just feel like if you take my side then I think like I've been spoiled to tell you about this, but then it's like he's been angry at me or maybe I'm just worried that if I tell you about it, you will show that you have been angry at me before but yeah, I guess you've got a point.\n",
            "Doctor: I see so which in that case confirm horrible things you think?\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: Already about yourself and yet there's a sense. I guess it's sort of feel like I was being sort of critical chance and that would be a cause of your wanted to take care of him.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: I don't think I'm very clear about that. It's not that I don't believe you is just that I don't I don't understand it like for the sake of teasing it out. So like that's ridiculous. That's totally unfair of him. Then I would feel like I was criticizing him or I would bet it would been like I was running him down. So I guess what I'm saying. I'm having trouble getting to them.\n",
            "Patient: I guess I would feel like by you telling me about this fight that we had and going to that kind of criticism. I would have betrayed James and some way.\n",
            "Doctor: I get the my criticism of him. That would be sort of devastating.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "Doctor: We should stop.\n",

And so it made me listen to them before I could listen to anything else. So there were two messages from this guy with the ambulance company has been this whole thing where Blue Cross said, they weren't going to pay for any of the ambulance from one of those times one of the times I was in the hospital because it was like a non-emergency thing and even though so we had to write a grievance to them to say while I didn't have the option of refusing to take the ambulance. Yeah.\", 'role': 'patient'}, {'content': 'This is like an ER to the hospital or something. Yeah.', 'role': 'doctor'}, {'content': \"And so that's been sent in and they've received it. Hopefully they'll pay for some of it at least but I had forgotten that that was sent in that we actually did that because I can't remember anything. So I just thought I'd been ignoring this guy from the ambulance company and then another message was I actually didn't make it through all the messages because I was freaking out too much. Yeah, I had to hang up. So I applied for this job as a substitute teacher in the city with the public schools like back in January or end of December. So I had a message from when I was in the hospital in January offering me a job interview. So that didn't happen. So, you know, I'm started freaking out just telling you about it. It was really freaking out listening to it. I got home and kind of fell apart and you know Jim's comforted me and everything. And that was the rest of the day like this happened right after my appointment with you yesterday and all I could do for the rest of the day with sit and read my book because every time I stopped and you know tried to actually get some work done or do anything I would just fall apart again. Yeah, I don't know how to live like this. It's like I spend so much of my energy not thinking about things while I mean, I can't deal with problems and then I don't have The attention that I ordinarily would have because you know a huge portion of my energy is going toward staving off this Panic that's there all the time. This morning was going okay, but I talked to Amanda on the phone and that was going okay, and she said she really thought that James and I should move to San Antonio and made a pretty good case for it just in terms of having a community, but I just couldn't handle that. I'm kind of trying to talk about anxiety and I feel like I've been trying to act like it's not as much of a big deal as it is, but it's just really devastating for me. I feel like it's crippling me. I'm so scared. I don't even know what I'm scared of. I'm just so scared.\", 'role': 'patient'}, {'content': \"Yeah. I think some of what you're scared of is like an intensity of your anger at yourself for not being able to handle things. You feel like you should be able to handle.\", 'role': 'doctor'}, {'content': 'Yeah, I do.', 'role': 'patient'}, {'content': \"I think now sometimes you do want to kill yourself for that or kill yourself so you don't have to feel that.\", 'role': 'doctor'}, {'content': \"Yeah.

But I hope I mean at some point I have to listen to the rest of my messages and I hope I'll be able to do that soon, but I don't know.

They affect you in a in a pretty waste it on the other side. I'm inclined to I'm in line not to say so much about because you seem pretty maxed out with what you can bear and I think that probably pretty well reflects a dilemma that you're in which is the things that could help weather is understanding or tasks. Sort of things or work often feel like way too much.\", 'role': 'doctor'}, {'content': \"Yeah, we went to dinner with Franco. In Franco's friends, and I went really well and I felt better while we were there, but I really didn't want to go. Yeah. Yeah, I really do want to hear the reasons because that wasn't really a rhetorical question and I feel like I want to know and in other ways I feel like they're not going to give any reasons that are good enough. Yeah, nothing adds up. So I just want to stay away from it. I must have read 400 pages in the last 24 hours. And in other ways understanding doesn't necessarily help. It's interesting. It's distracting sometimes. It's hard for me to think about just the possibility that greater understanding wouldn't be helpful. I mean, I feel like it's kind of one of the foundational principles of life, but like knowing is better knowing will help.\", 'role': 'patient'}, {'content': \"I think when it comes to this stuff, I think you want to think knowing won't help because I think you don't want to know.

I have become really intolerable for you and some of Y. And it's really hard to keep that in mind. I think I mean like the phone messages I think are actually maybe just the right metaphor like, you know, they're there and it's terrifying because you know, you may not be able to Bear hearing them. and if we wanted to think about it for a few minutes because probably getting much more particular about what would be hard about hearing them the message that you had a job interview, you know, and you never got Not far from stuff we talked about. Again, I don't have a complete understanding or I'm sure that there's a lot of important contacts that I don't have.\", 'role': 'doctor'}, {'content': 'Yeah.', 'role': 'patient'}, {'content': \"But yeah, I think you also.

Like it may not be I'm just going to throw it out there. So anyway and won't think about it. So there may be times when you're feeling when your feelings are so intent and you come on in your kind of subtle way.
